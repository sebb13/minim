<content>There are various artists named Fabian:&#10;&#10;1)  Fabiano Anthony Forte (born February 6, 1943, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania),is an American teen idol of the late 1950s and early 1960s. He rose to national prominence after performing several times on American Bandstand. In total, he charted 11 hit singles on the Billboard Hot 100.&#10;abian was discovered in 1957 by Bob Marcucci and Peter DeAngelis, owners of Chancellor Records. At the time, record producers were looking to the South Philadelphia neighborhoods in search of teenage talents with good looks, and Frankie Avalon, also of South Philly, suggested Fabian as a possibility.&#10;With songwriters Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, Fabian released a series of hit singles for Chancellor Records including &quot;I&apos;m a Man&quot;, &quot;Hound Dog Man&quot;, a #9 hit in the U.S., &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot; (U.S. #9), and his biggest hit, &quot;Tiger&quot;, which reached number 3 in the U.S. charts. Other singles that charted included &quot;String Along&quot;, &quot;About This Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;This Friendly World&quot;, which reached #12 on the U.S. charts.&#10;His career in music basically ended after he bought out of his contract with Marcucci after signing a seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox. During the payola scandal of the 1960s, Fabian testified before Congress that his recordings had been doctored electonically to significantly improve his voice.&#10;&#10;2) Fabian Ordorica of Los Angeles. Churning out heavy apocalyptic electro powerhouses and pop gems alike, Fabian is a multi-talented musician and producer. His songs are heavy, dark, and taking dance music in an entirely new direction. His live show is entirely original productions strung together in a non-stop, melt your face revolution. He promises to get any group of people in front of him dancing until their clothes are soaked. Since his productions are original, his live set will never get stale, and promises to get the interest of anyone seeing him play. He is a member of the Binary Family, a fast rising label of electronic musicians in Los Angeles.&#10;&#10;3) Fabian Feyaerts is the Belgian representative at Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2012. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Fabian&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Michelle Lynn Johnson officially changed her professional name from Me&apos;Shell NdegéOcello to simply Meshell Ndegeocello, with the release of her 2001 album, &quot;Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape&quot;.&#10;&#10;Meshell Ndegeocello (b. August 29, 1968) is a singer, bassist, and multi-instrumentalist. She was born Michelle Johnson to Army lieutenant (and saxophonist) father Jacques Johnson and her mother, Helen in Berlin, Germany.&#10;&#10;Raised in Washington, D.C., Meshell Suihailia Bashir Shakur (as she became known) adopted the surname Ndegeocello, which means &quot;free like a bird&quot;, while still in her teens. She has been hailed in the music press as a redeemer of soul music. Her music incorporates funk, soul, hip-hop, reggae, rock and jazz. She has been nominated for 9 Grammys. She has frequently toured with Lilith Fair.&#10;&#10;Ndegeocello honed her chops on the D.C. Go go circuit in the late 1980s before venturing out as a solo artist. She emerged as a recording artist in 1993 on Maverick Records/Sire Records with her debut, Plantation Lullabies. This recording presented a distinctly androgynous persona. Her music has been featured in a number of film soundtracks including How Stella Got Her Groove Back and Batman and Robin. She has also appeared on recordings by Basement Jaxx and The Blind Boys of Alabama, among others. Her biggest hit is a duet with John Cougar Mellencamp, a cover version of Van Morrison&apos;s &quot;Wild Night&quot;, which reached #3 on the Billboard charts.&#10;&#10;Her singles &quot;If That&apos;s Your Boyfriend (He Wasn&apos;t Last Night)&quot;, &quot;Leviticus: Faggot&quot;, and her cover of Bill Withers &quot;Who Is He and What Is He To You?&quot; have all charted in the Billboard top 20. She sang background vocals on the song &quot;I&apos;d Rather be Your Lover&quot; by Madonna, on her album &quot;Bedtime Stories.&quot;. She also sang with Chaka Khan on the single &quot;Never Miss the Water&quot;, as well as providing her typical solid bass skills.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Meshell+Ndegeocello&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>There are several artists with this name:&#10;&#10;1) The Lions.

It was recorded in under 15 hours, mixed and mastered in less than a week. The band proudly wear there influences on there sleeves. Without reinventing the wheel or pretending to say they sound original, The Lions attempt to capture the riffs of Jimi Hendrix on a 7-string Ibanez and recite the melodies of The Beatles.&#10;&#10;2) The Lions. The band draws together a dozen or so of LA’s elite reggae and soul forerunners who loosely coalesced as The Lions in 2007. Members of the legendary ska band Hepcat, Deston Berry and Alex Désert, form half of the vocal team, and the latter also has a successful career on screen, including roles in the films Swingers and High Fidelity.  The other half is the sweet falsetto of Malik Moore and DJ stylings of Black Shakespeare, the charismatic cousin of Robbie Shakespeare (of Sly &amp; Robbie fame) and co-runner of the i&amp;i Sound System, a customized ice cream van bringing bass to the streets of the west coast and featured on the cover of both Saul Williams’ self-titled album and an issue of XLR8R Magazine.&#10;&#10;Other members include guitarist Dan Ubick, formerly of Breakestra, Macy Gray co-writer and collaborator Dave Wilder on bass, plus musicians who have played with the likes of De La Soul, Barrington Levy, Beck, Raphael Saadiq, Big Daddy Kane and Black Eyed Peas.&#10;&#10;Inspired by reggae, sound system culture and the myriad of musical styles influenced by Jamaican music old and new, The Lions’ sound is firmly placed in soul music. &#10;&#10;3) The Lions. There is also a chill-out/electronic project by the name of &apos;The Lions&apos;, born from amateur music producer/composer Josh Down. &apos;The Lions&apos; releases can be downloaded, for free, from the website www.freewebs.com/lionsthe... &apos;The Lions&apos; also has a strong connection to the film, &apos;The Lion King&apos;, and every track has quotes, sampled straight from the film.&#10;&#10;4) The Lions (Ha&apos;arayot) there is also a israeli early pop-rock band from the 60&apos;-70&apos;.&#10;&#10;5) The Lions are a melodic DIY punk band from Kyoto, Japan featuring members of Hanshin Tigers and The Paper Toys. &#10;&#10;6) The Lions are a 60s garage band from Denmark &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/The+Lions&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

A brilliant scholar, he prepared for the entrance exam to the Centrale (engineering school) and Sup-Aero at Montpellier, but was conscripted into the Youth Building Projects in 1942 and sent to Germany in 1943 for compulsory work service. He escaped the same year, and found work as a diver in La Ciotat, a suburb of Marseilles, in 1944.&#10;&#10;In 1946, he married Colette Maclaud. They had two children, Ticha (born 1948) and Jacky (1950).&#10;&#10;His first published work, Les douze chants d&apos;un imbecile, appeared in 1951. He moved to Paris and opened a fashion and baby clothes shop, still writing and producing plays. Later, he switched to being a fitter of TV aerials and began singing.&#10;&#10;In the 1960s, Boby Lapointe started an actor’s career and acted in films by some of the greatest French directors, among which François Truffaut and Claude Sautet.&#10;&#10;His fame grew when the actor Bourvil sang Lapointe&apos;s song Aragon et Castille in the 1954 film Poisson d&apos;avril. In 1960, film director François Truffaut offered him a part in Tirez sur le Pianiste in which he played Framboise, accompanied by Charles Aznavour on piano. This marked the start of a career that saw Lapointe perform at major venues throughout France. His joyful character led him to build friendships with French stars Anne Sylvestre, Raymond Devos, Jacques Brel and Georges Brassens.&#10;&#10;Lapointe was also a mathematician, and developed the bi-bi-binary system (also known as the bibi system) in 1971. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Boby+Lapointe&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24, 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota, United States) is an American musician, poet and artist whose position in popular culture is unique.&#10;&#10;Dylan started his musical odyssey in 1959 when he began playing in Dinkytown, Minneapolis while attending the University of Minnesota. Shortly after starting to play he changed his stage name to Bob Dylan, after being influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas before legally changing his name in 1962. &#10;&#10;Much of his best known work is from the 1960s, when he became an informal documentarian and reluctant figurehead of American unrest, promoted by Joan Baez. Some of his songs, such as &quot;Blowin&apos; in the Wind&quot; and &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin&apos;&quot;, became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements, with Joan Baez and Dylan singing together at the March on Washington in 1963. However he later became disenchanted with the and civil liberty protest scene, feeling that he had been used by them.&#10;&#10;His album Bringing It All Back Home marked a move away from the folk scene and a move towards rock and roll and Dylan began to consciously distance himself from his early association with civil rights. He also started to become irritated when being interviewed, often given facetious or irreverent answers to questions. Bringing It All Back Home was a controversial album as it the first on which he played electric guitar. This was seen by some of his fans as a betrayal of this folk roots, with some saying that it obscured his meaningful and poetic lyrics.&#10;&#10;The second half of the 1960s was marked by a string of well received releases, with his song &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, released in July of 1965, later being named &quot;The Greatest Song of All Time&quot; by Rolling Stone magazine in 2004, placing #1 in a list of 500 titles. It also marked the formation of Dylan&apos;s backing band The Hawks (who would later call themselves simply The Band). Dylan embarked on a world tour of Australia and Europe in 1966, during which he seemed to be under a lot of strain and pressure by both his fans, the music press and his own promoters. Dylan himself admitted that he began taking drugs seriously whilst on this tour, and found it immensely hard work. On returning to New York he crashed his motorbike, sustaining serious injuries in the process, and went into a period of withdrawal while he recuperated. During the late 1960s, Dylan again changed stylistic tradition, moving away from the psychedelic culture of the time. It was then that he recorded All Along the Watchtower, perhaps more famously recorded by Jimi Hendrix.&#10;&#10;The 1970s were a period during which Dylan was more sporadic in his output, releasing some poorly received LPs. He rarely appeared in person until 1973, when he began touring again with his backing band The Band. He also wrote one of his most extensively covered songs, Knockin&apos; On Heaven&apos;s Door, as well as what is now recognised as one of his best albums Blood On The Tracks. Towards the end of the 1970s, Dylan discovered God, and released some albums of gospel music. He started to talk to the crowd about his faith during his performances, and wouldn&apos;t play any of his early work, which alienated some of his previous fans.&#10;&#10;Dylan today still remains an influential and popular artist; despite a period of little note between 1970-2000, his 2006 album Modern Times reached the US chart at #1, as did his 2009 album Together Through Life, in the US, Britain, France and several other countries. His 2012 album Tempest was also critically acclaimed. Since 1988, Dylan has been on the so-called Never Ending Tour, during which his performanes have provoked controversy, with some critics claiming that his lyrics have become incomprehensible, an experience which is not helped by his tendency to change his set-list and vocals almost every performance.&#10;&#10;Bob Dylan&apos;s strong influence over the past few years is becoming even more prominent amongst a growing group of younger emerging artists such as George Ellias and Devendra Banhart. Dylan&apos;s early lyrics incorporated politics, social commentary, philosophy and literary influences, defying existing pop music conventions and appealing widely to the counterculture of the time. While expanding and personalizing musical styles, Dylan has shown steadfast devotion to traditions of American song, from folk and country/blues to rock and roll and rockabilly, to Gaelic balladry, even jazz, swing and Broadway.&#10;&#10;Dylan performs with the guitar, keyboard and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s. He has also recently performed alongside other iconic artists, such as Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Tom Petty and Eric Clapton. Although his contributions as a performer and recording artist have been central to his career, his songwriting is generally held as his highest accomplishment.  &#10;&#10;Nobel Prize for Literature (2016)  - On October 13, 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition”. The prestigious award has been given annually since 1901 and previous Nobel Laureates for Literature include Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett. Here is the speech written by Dylan, although unable to attend:&#10;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/10/arts/bob-dylan-nobel-prize-acceptance-speech.html?_r=0&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

In their second year of studies, Newman showed Sainsbury a handful of his own songs inspired by his guitar-playing dad and hallucinogens, and the pair began recording in their dorm rooms with Sainsbury acting as producer on Garageband. &#10;&#10;First as Daljit Dhaliwal and then as Films, the four friends spent the next two years playing around town.&#10;&#10;Their eponymous first 4-track demo ∆, was recorded with producer Charlie Andrew in London and showcased the tracks &quot;Breezeblocks&quot;, &quot;Hand-Made&quot;, &quot;Matilda&quot; and &quot;Tessellate&quot;. A 7&quot; containing &quot;Bloodflood&quot; and &quot;Tessellate&quot; was released by Loud and Quiet on October 2011.&#10;&#10;Their first 2012 release for Infectious was the triangle shaped 7&quot; &quot;Matilda&quot; / &quot;Fitzpleasure&quot;, followed by &quot;Breezeblocks&quot; as an advance of their first album An Awesome Wave, released on 25 May 2012. That same year, they won the prestigious Barclaycard Mercury Prize for An Awesome Wave.&#10;&#10;On January 2014, Sainsbury announced that he had left the band. &quot;Hunger of the pine&quot; premièred in June, as an advance of their sophomore album This is all yours released at the end of September.&#10;&#10;http://altjband.com   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/alt-J&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>CocoRosie is an American duo formed in 2003 by sisters Bianca &quot;Coco&quot; and Sierra &quot;Rosie&quot; Casady. The sisters were born and raised in the United States (Sierra, the older of the two, was born in Iowa, and Bianca was born in Hawaii), but formed the band in Paris, France after meeting for the first time in years. Their mother nicknamed them Rosie and Coco, respectively, from which their musical act takes its name. Their music has been called freak folk, and incorporates elements of pop, blues, opera, electronica, and hip hop.&#10;CocoRosie began as a duo, with Sierra singing, playing the guitar, piano and harp, and Bianca singing and manipulating various children&apos;s toys, electronic and percussion instruments, as well as other exotic noisemakers. They subsequently added various backing musicians, usually a bassist, keyboardist, and beatboxer. They have been a very active touring group, playing across Europe, the United States, and elsewhere. &#10;They have released six full-length albums: La maison de mon rêve (2004),  Noah&apos;s Ark (2005),  The Adventures of Ghosthorse and Stillborn (2007),  Grey Oceans (2010), Tales of a GrassWidow (2013) and Heartache City (2015).&#10;&#10;In 2003, Bianca was growing restless and decided it was time for a change. Leaving her apartment in Brooklyn to travel the world, she ended up at Sierra&apos;s apartment in Paris. Over the course of the next two months, the women spent nearly every waking hour in Sierra&apos;s bathroom, chosen as the most acoustic and isolated room in the apartment. Soon, they had completed both a hip-hop recording (never released) called &quot;word to the crow&quot; and their proper debut album La Maison de Mon Rêve.&#10;&#10;Originally, La Maison de Mon Rêve was only intended to be distributed within a close circle of friends. However, by 2004 the lo-fi album had been released on independent label Touch and Go Records, who had obtained a copy of the CD and had uncharacteristically pursued signing the artists. Since the creation of their first album, the Casady sisters have been virtually inseparable.&#10;&#10;Stylistically they may be assigned to the indie rock, psychedelic folk, folktronica genres, and are sometimes associated with the New Weird America movement. Sierra, who studied operatic vocal techniques, takes the lead vocals and also plays guitar, harp and flute. Bianca is a percussionist and also beatboxes. The group also uses various objects such as toys to construct their unique sound. Popular indie bands such as The xx name them as a major influence.&#10;&#10;They were actively touring during most of 2004, playing across the U.S. and throughout Europe with artists such as TV on the Radio, Bright Eyes, Battles, Devendra Banhart, and Busdriver among others.&#10;&#10;Official website: http://www.cocorosiemusic.com &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/CocoRosie&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Lorenzo Aitken (22 April 1927 – 17 July 2005), better known by the stage name Laurel Aitken, was an influential Caribbean singer and one of the pioneers of Jamaican ska music. He is often referred to as the &quot;Godfather of Ska&quot;.&#10;&#10;Born in Cuba of mixed Cuban and Jamaican descent, Aitken and his family settled in Jamaica in 1938. After an early career working for the Jamaican Tourist Board singing mento songs for visitors arriving at Kingston Harbour, he became a popular nightclub entertainer. His first recordings in the late 1950s were mento tunes such as &quot;Nebuchnezer&quot;, &quot;Sweet Chariot&quot; (aka the gospel classic &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot;) and &quot;Baba Kill Me Goat&quot;. Aitken&apos;s 1958 single &quot;Boogie in My Bones&quot;/&quot;Little Sheila&quot; was one of the first records produced by Chris Blackwell and the first Jamaican popular music record to be released in the United Kingdom. Other more Jamaican rhythm and blues orientated singles from this period include &quot;Low Down Dirty Girl&quot; and &quot;More Whisky&quot; both produced by Duke Reid.&#10;&#10;Aitken moved to Brixton, London, in 1960 and recorded for the Blue Beat label, releasing fifteen singles before returning to Jamaica in 1963. He recorded for Duke Reid, with backing from the Skatalites on tracks such as &quot;Zion&quot; and &quot;Weary Wanderer&quot;, before returning to the UK, where he began working with Pama Records. He recorded hits such as &quot;Fire in Mi Wire&quot; and &quot;Landlord and Tenants&quot;, which led to a wider recognition outside of Jamaica and the UK. This cemented his position as one of ska&apos;s leading artists and earned him the nicknames The Godfather of Ska, and later Boss Skinhead. He gained a loyal following not only among the West Indian community, but also among mods, skinheads and other ska fans. He had hit records in the United Kingdom and other countries in the 1950s through to the 1970s on labels such as Blue Beat, Pama, Trojan, Rio, Dr. Bird, Nu-Beat, Ska-Beat,Hot Lead and Dice. Some of his singles featured B-sides credited to his brother, guitarist Bobby Aitken. Aitken also recorded a few talk-over/deejay tracks under the guise of &apos;King Horror&apos;, such as &quot;Loch Ness Monster&quot;, &quot;Dracula, Prince of Darkness&quot;, and &quot;The Hole&quot;. Aitken settled in Leicester with his wife in 1970. His output slowed in the 1970s and during this period he worked as an entertainer in nightclubs and restaurants in the area including the popular &apos;Costa Brava Restaurant&apos; in Leicester under his real name Lorenzo. In 1980, with ska enjoying a resurgence in the wake of the 2 Tone movement, Aitken had his only success in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Rudi Got Married&quot; (#60) released on I-Spy Records (the label created and managed by Secret Affair. Aitken&apos;s career took in mento/calypso, R&amp;B, ska, rock steady, and reggae, and in the 1990s he even turned his talents to dancehall. He performed occasional concerts almost until his death from a heart attack in 2005. After a long campaign, a blue plaque in his honour was put up at his Leicester home in 2007. Punk band Rancid cover&apos;s Aitken&apos;s Everybody Suffering on their 2014 LP Honor Is All We Know&#10;&#10;&#10;Laurel Aitken (April 22, 1927 - July 17, 2005) became famous as one of the originators of Jamaican ska music in the late 1950s.&#10;&#10;Aitken was born as Lorenzo Aitken in Cuba, and is the brother of singer Bobby Aitken. He moved to England in the 1960s, and had a loyal following among Skinheads and other ska fans. He had massive hits in the 1950s through 1970s, while recording for Blue Beat Records, Pama Records and Trojan Records. He recorded one of the earliest ska records, the double A-sided Boogie in My Bones / Little Sheila (1958). It was the first record on producer Chris Blackwell&apos;s Island Records label.&#10;&#10;Aitken, who is known as &quot;The Godfather of Ska&quot;, made his home in Leicester UK and performed live almost until his death. He suffered from a serious illness following a heart attack about a year before he died. He died from a heart attack in Leicester, UK on July 17, 2005. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Laurel+Aitken&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Amon Tobin (born Amon Adonai Santos de Araújo Tobin on February 7, 1972) is a Brazilian musician, composer and producer of electronic music. He is described as a virtuoso sound designer and is considered to be one of the most influential electronic music artists in the world. He is noted for his unusual methodology in sound design and music production. He has released seven major studio albums under the London-based Ninja Tune record label.&#10;&#10;It began for him sometime in the mid-90s when, as a fresh-faced Brazilian ex-pat living in the UK, he decided he was going to put down his harmonica, pick up a sampler, and name himself after a Stephen King novel. The resulting album, Cujo&apos;s Adventures In Foam (released on Ninebar records, later reissued on Ninja Tune) signalled Amon Tobin&apos;s entry into the world of music.&#10;&#10;Immediately upon hearing this record, the powers that be at Ninja Tune signed him up to record as Amon Tobin, and he quickly went to work on his debut Bricolage. If you&apos;ll recall, these were the trip-hop years for electronic music, where any clown with a sampler and a collection of Blue Note records could knock off some half-baked boutique hotel background music. But Bricolage shone above all that. Although employing a marriage of jazz and beats, it stretched it further by bringing in elements of bossa-nova, batucada, and jungle, and combining it with a sense of song-writing that elevated it above the standards of that aforementioned scene. There is a song on it which was inspired by Amon urinating on his neighbor&apos;s bike after a domestic living dispute (One Day In My Garden)... this was clearly the no-good vibes-jazzy-beats guy Ninja had signed.&#10;&#10;Next up came Permutation. Although stylistically a logical follow up to Bricolage, it was also on this album where things starting taking a noticeable turn to a much darker output. In fact you can actually trace Amon&apos;s career based on coffee shop &amp; dinner party accessibility... and let&apos;s just say that this record signalled the end of anyone being able to use Amon records as background music. This one cut a wide path; from the film tributes of Like Regular Chickens &amp; People Like Frank, to the monster breaks on Sordid (easily his biggest &apos;hit&apos; in the catalog), to the caravan-esque shuffle of &quot;Nightlife,&quot; and ending with the ultra-lush Nova (which later was used for Bebel Gilberto&apos;s Samba Da Bencao on her debut album).&#10;&#10;Call it end of millennium tension, but while the rest of us were out stockpiling food for the apocalypse, Amon was channelling all that into his next release Supermodified. Treating it like if this was the end of the human race as we knew it and computers would never work again (or god forbid, if we were to be ruled by apes), then damn if he wasn&apos;t going make this banger before the lights went out. If Amon&apos;s career is a 4LP set, then this 3rd instalment appropriately comes off like the 3rd side of any 4LP 70s rock opus... a time to push some boundaries, challenge the fans a bit, and set the stage for what&apos;s to come later. The record was an experiment in sound. Marking the point where Amon became more and more obsessed with unheard but felt bass frequencies, and where he allowed a few collaborators into the mix (mainly Chris Morris of Brass Eye &amp; Blue Jam fame, and Montreal beatboxer Quadraceptor). The record where the Bossa-nova/jazz Amon Tobin was for the most part laid to rest and the dark/electronic/soundtrack Amon Tobin came into form. Four Ton Mantis is a classic, Deo would have done Sergio Leone proud, and Get Your Snack On paid tribute to one of the Internet&apos;s finest fake commercials. In 2002, Amon decided to relocate to Montreal. As Ninja Tune&apos;s North American headquarters is based there he&apos;d spent a lot of time soaking in the culture and summer sunshine of the city, never once thinking that he&apos;d never actually visited during the winter... &#10;&#10;Somewhere around the time he felt the sensation of his nose hairs freezing for the first time, so settled into his new studio armed with a fresh set-up and an A La Carte Express menu by his side (Montreal&apos;s bible of food for shut-ins) to put the finishing touches on Out From Out Where. When Sun Ra penned the song Out From Out There, &apos;there&apos; clearly meant outer space. When Amon decided to call his record Out From Out Where, the &apos;where&apos; meant just that... a record that came from somewhere nobody could quite pinpoint. This was the logical conclusion of what the previous records had hinted at. It was a cohesive and banging record, but one with no obvious reference points. It just sounded like Amon Tobin, and Amon (more so than a lot of artists) can actually say his sound is very much recognizable as his own. This was wide screen Amon, dropping the cut-up hip-hop of verbal, the Eli Wallach inspired Hey Blondie, the future electro-disco of Cosmo Retro Intro Outro, and the terrifying death march of Proper Hoodidge.  The tour for this album also resulted in Amon&apos;s entry into the Solid Steel mix series, with a tough ass Final Scratch DJ set captured in Australia released in June 2004.&#10;&#10;In early 2004 video game developers Ubisoft approached Amon and asked him to compose all of the music for the 3rd installment of their enormously popular Splinter Cell series. Seeing as he wasn&apos;t able to get past the second mission of the first Splinter Cell, he thought that making the soundtrack would clearly be an easier way to interact with the game. This was a chance for Amon to experiment with different ways of composing and to finally realize a teenage ambition (although this soundtrack in no way reflects his love for Galaga - even though that was a hot game). Composing a proper soundtrack also allowed him to be a little more progressively excessive, with the inclusion of extended string arrangements and over the top Hammond organ solos woven into his sounds. Italian prog sensation Goblin composing for a Bond film would be an apt comparison for this work. A love of soundtracks has always been a key influence in his work, and it clearly shows here. The game was released in 2005. An accompanying soundtrack on Ninja Tune was released in Jan 05. A 5.1 DVD-Audio version was released simultaneously with the game, putting Amon at the forefront, as always, of pushing sounds forward.&#10;&#10;Foley Room was released in 2007 and used the eponymous Foley Rooms at Ubisoft. Sound effects were recorded to create original sounds for the album rather than exclusively beat-sampling. The original concept was derived from an ambition to create an album based on &quot;sound&quot;. High-resolution bit samples, gated and distorted to produce similar wave patterns as purely synth-based music. Tracks further into the album include melodic instrument samples, notably The Kronos Quartet provide samples.&#10;&#10;Recent Activity:&#10;&#10;On September 8 2010, Esther&apos;s Video - directed by Charles De Meyer (aka Chuck Eklectric) was debuted on amontobin.com along with limited edition Monthly Joints Picture Disc vinyl as well as a package of Designer Sounds with Ableton files.&#10;&#10;On June 14, 2010 Amon Tobin released a free download of a 4 Deck Set recorded in Seattle in 2009. It is available on his website http://amontobin.com as a free download.&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Amon+Tobin&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Claudine Georgette Longet (born January 29, 1942 in Paris), was a popular singer and recording artist in the 1960s and 1970s. She was best known as the ex-wife of singer Andy Williams and later for being convicted of &quot;misdemeanor negligent homicide&quot; in the death of skiing star Spider Sabich.&#10;&#10;She was a dancer at the Folies Bergere in Las Vegas. and met Andy Williams when he pulled over to aid her on a desert road. They married on Christmas Day 1961 and had three children, Noelle, Christian and Robert. In 1968, she appeared in &quot;The Party&quot; with Peter Sellers and sang &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot; by Henry Mancini. Longet recorded a series of five MOR albums for A&amp;M Records between 1966 and 1970 and two albums for Williams&apos;s Barnaby label in 1971 and 1972. She also made frequent acting appearances in television series and appeared from time to time on Williams&apos; variety series and specials. Williams called Longet a beautiful, sleek brunette with large doe eyes, &quot;my favorite French singer&quot;. She and Williams separated in 1969 but did not divorce until 6 years later.&#10;&#10;Longet has never performed again after the criminal trial, and the Sabich family initiated civil proceedings to sue Longet. The case was eventually settled out of court for a large monetary settlement, with the proviso that Longet never tell or write about her story. They also demanded that Claudine withdraw from public circulation her recording of &quot;Bang Bang, My Baby Shot Me Down.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Claudine+Longet&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>There are various artists named Fabian:&#10;&#10;1)  Fabiano Anthony Forte (born February 6, 1943, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania),is an American teen idol of the late 1950s and early 1960s. He rose to national prominence after performing several times on American Bandstand. In total, he charted 11 hit singles on the Billboard Hot 100.&#10;abian was discovered in 1957 by Bob Marcucci and Peter DeAngelis, owners of Chancellor Records. At the time, record producers were looking to the South Philadelphia neighborhoods in search of teenage talents with good looks, and Frankie Avalon, also of South Philly, suggested Fabian as a possibility.&#10;With songwriters Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, Fabian released a series of hit singles for Chancellor Records including &quot;I&apos;m a Man&quot;, &quot;Hound Dog Man&quot;, a #9 hit in the U.S., &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot; (U.S. #9), and his biggest hit, &quot;Tiger&quot;, which reached number 3 in the U.S. charts. Other singles that charted included &quot;String Along&quot;, &quot;About This Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;This Friendly World&quot;, which reached #12 on the U.S. charts.&#10;His career in music basically ended after he bought out of his contract with Marcucci after signing a seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox. During the payola scandal of the 1960s, Fabian testified before Congress that his recordings had been doctored electonically to significantly improve his voice.&#10;&#10;2) Fabian Ordorica of Los Angeles. Churning out heavy apocalyptic electro powerhouses and pop gems alike, Fabian is a multi-talented musician and producer. His songs are heavy, dark, and taking dance music in an entirely new direction. His live show is entirely original productions strung together in a non-stop, melt your face revolution. He promises to get any group of people in front of him dancing until their clothes are soaked. Since his productions are original, his live set will never get stale, and promises to get the interest of anyone seeing him play. He is a member of the Binary Family, a fast rising label of electronic musicians in Los Angeles.&#10;&#10;3) Fabian Feyaerts is the Belgian representative at Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2012. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Fabian&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Michelle Lynn Johnson officially changed her professional name from Me&apos;Shell NdegéOcello to simply Meshell Ndegeocello, with the release of her 2001 album, &quot;Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape&quot;.&#10;&#10;Meshell Ndegeocello (b. August 29, 1968) is a singer, bassist, and multi-instrumentalist. She was born Michelle Johnson to Army lieutenant (and saxophonist) father Jacques Johnson and her mother, Helen in Berlin, Germany.&#10;&#10;Raised in Washington, D.C., Meshell Suihailia Bashir Shakur (as she became known) adopted the surname Ndegeocello, which means &quot;free like a bird&quot;, while still in her teens. She has been hailed in the music press as a redeemer of soul music. Her music incorporates funk, soul, hip-hop, reggae, rock and jazz. She has been nominated for 9 Grammys. She has frequently toured with Lilith Fair.&#10;&#10;Ndegeocello honed her chops on the D.C. Go go circuit in the late 1980s before venturing out as a solo artist. She emerged as a recording artist in 1993 on Maverick Records/Sire Records with her debut, Plantation Lullabies. This recording presented a distinctly androgynous persona. Her music has been featured in a number of film soundtracks including How Stella Got Her Groove Back and Batman and Robin. She has also appeared on recordings by Basement Jaxx and The Blind Boys of Alabama, among others. Her biggest hit is a duet with John Cougar Mellencamp, a cover version of Van Morrison&apos;s &quot;Wild Night&quot;, which reached #3 on the Billboard charts.&#10;&#10;Her singles &quot;If That&apos;s Your Boyfriend (He Wasn&apos;t Last Night)&quot;, &quot;Leviticus: Faggot&quot;, and her cover of Bill Withers &quot;Who Is He and What Is He To You?&quot; have all charted in the Billboard top 20. She sang background vocals on the song &quot;I&apos;d Rather be Your Lover&quot; by Madonna, on her album &quot;Bedtime Stories.&quot;. She also sang with Chaka Khan on the single &quot;Never Miss the Water&quot;, as well as providing her typical solid bass skills.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Meshell+Ndegeocello&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>There are several artists with this name:&#10;&#10;1) The Lions.

It was recorded in under 15 hours, mixed and mastered in less than a week. The band proudly wear there influences on there sleeves. Without reinventing the wheel or pretending to say they sound original, The Lions attempt to capture the riffs of Jimi Hendrix on a 7-string Ibanez and recite the melodies of The Beatles.&#10;&#10;2) The Lions. The band draws together a dozen or so of LA’s elite reggae and soul forerunners who loosely coalesced as The Lions in 2007. Members of the legendary ska band Hepcat, Deston Berry and Alex Désert, form half of the vocal team, and the latter also has a successful career on screen, including roles in the films Swingers and High Fidelity.  The other half is the sweet falsetto of Malik Moore and DJ stylings of Black Shakespeare, the charismatic cousin of Robbie Shakespeare (of Sly &amp; Robbie fame) and co-runner of the i&amp;i Sound System, a customized ice cream van bringing bass to the streets of the west coast and featured on the cover of both Saul Williams’ self-titled album and an issue of XLR8R Magazine.&#10;&#10;Other members include guitarist Dan Ubick, formerly of Breakestra, Macy Gray co-writer and collaborator Dave Wilder on bass, plus musicians who have played with the likes of De La Soul, Barrington Levy, Beck, Raphael Saadiq, Big Daddy Kane and Black Eyed Peas.&#10;&#10;Inspired by reggae, sound system culture and the myriad of musical styles influenced by Jamaican music old and new, The Lions’ sound is firmly placed in soul music. &#10;&#10;3) The Lions. There is also a chill-out/electronic project by the name of &apos;The Lions&apos;, born from amateur music producer/composer Josh Down. &apos;The Lions&apos; releases can be downloaded, for free, from the website www.freewebs.com/lionsthe... &apos;The Lions&apos; also has a strong connection to the film, &apos;The Lion King&apos;, and every track has quotes, sampled straight from the film.&#10;&#10;4) The Lions (Ha&apos;arayot) there is also a israeli early pop-rock band from the 60&apos;-70&apos;.&#10;&#10;5) The Lions are a melodic DIY punk band from Kyoto, Japan featuring members of Hanshin Tigers and The Paper Toys. &#10;&#10;6) The Lions are a 60s garage band from Denmark &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/The+Lions&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Robert (Boby) Lapointe (April 16, 1922 - June 29, 1972) was a French singer, noted for his humorous texts full of puns, alliterations, spoonerisms and paronyms. He was a friend of Georges Brassens who helped him along on the Parisian scene.&#10;&#10;He was born in Pézenas, in the Hérault département of France. A brilliant scholar, he prepared for the entrance exam to the Centrale (engineering school) and Sup-Aero at Montpellier, but was conscripted into the Youth Building Projects in 1942 and sent to Germany in 1943 for compulsory work service. He escaped the same year, and found work as a diver in La Ciotat, a suburb of Marseilles, in 1944.&#10;&#10;In 1946, he married Colette Maclaud. They had two children, Ticha (born 1948) and Jacky (1950).&#10;&#10;His first published work, Les douze chants d&apos;un imbecile, appeared in 1951. He moved to Paris and opened a fashion and baby clothes shop, still writing and producing plays. Later, he switched to being a fitter of TV aerials and began singing.&#10;&#10;In the 1960s, Boby Lapointe started an actor’s career and acted in films by some of the greatest French directors, among which François Truffaut and Claude Sautet.&#10;&#10;His fame grew when the actor Bourvil sang Lapointe&apos;s song Aragon et Castille in the 1954 film Poisson d&apos;avril. In 1960, film director François Truffaut offered him a part in Tirez sur le Pianiste in which he played Framboise, accompanied by Charles Aznavour on piano. This marked the start of a career that saw Lapointe perform at major venues throughout France. His joyful character led him to build friendships with French stars Anne Sylvestre, Raymond Devos, Jacques Brel and Georges Brassens.&#10;&#10;Lapointe was also a mathematician, and developed the bi-bi-binary system (also known as the bibi system) in 1971. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Boby+Lapointe&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24, 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota, United States) is an American musician, poet and artist whose position in popular culture is unique.&#10;&#10;Dylan started his musical odyssey in 1959 when he began playing in Dinkytown, Minneapolis while attending the University of Minnesota. Shortly after starting to play he changed his stage name to Bob Dylan, after being influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas before legally changing his name in 1962. &#10;&#10;Much of his best known work is from the 1960s, when he became an informal documentarian and reluctant figurehead of American unrest, promoted by Joan Baez. Some of his songs, such as &quot;Blowin&apos; in the Wind&quot; and &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin&apos;&quot;, became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements, with Joan Baez and Dylan singing together at the March on Washington in 1963. However he later became disenchanted with the and civil liberty protest scene, feeling that he had been used by them.&#10;&#10;His album Bringing It All Back Home marked a move away from the folk scene and a move towards rock and roll and Dylan began to consciously distance himself from his early association with civil rights. He also started to become irritated when being interviewed, often given facetious or irreverent answers to questions. Bringing It All Back Home was a controversial album as it the first on which he played electric guitar. This was seen by some of his fans as a betrayal of this folk roots, with some saying that it obscured his meaningful and poetic lyrics.&#10;&#10;The second half of the 1960s was marked by a string of well received releases, with his song &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, released in July of 1965, later being named &quot;The Greatest Song of All Time&quot; by Rolling Stone magazine in 2004, placing #1 in a list of 500 titles. It also marked the formation of Dylan&apos;s backing band The Hawks (who would later call themselves simply The Band). Dylan embarked on a world tour of Australia and Europe in 1966, during which he seemed to be under a lot of strain and pressure by both his fans, the music press and his own promoters. Dylan himself admitted that he began taking drugs seriously whilst on this tour, and found it immensely hard work. On returning to New York he crashed his motorbike, sustaining serious injuries in the process, and went into a period of withdrawal while he recuperated. During the late 1960s, Dylan again changed stylistic tradition, moving away from the psychedelic culture of the time. It was then that he recorded All Along the Watchtower, perhaps more famously recorded by Jimi Hendrix.&#10;&#10;The 1970s were a period during which Dylan was more sporadic in his output, releasing some poorly received LPs. He rarely appeared in person until 1973, when he began touring again with his backing band The Band. He also wrote one of his most extensively covered songs, Knockin&apos; On Heaven&apos;s Door, as well as what is now recognised as one of his best albums Blood On The Tracks. Towards the end of the 1970s, Dylan discovered God, and released some albums of gospel music. He started to talk to the crowd about his faith during his performances, and wouldn&apos;t play any of his early work, which alienated some of his previous fans.&#10;&#10;Dylan today still remains an influential and popular artist; despite a period of little note between 1970-2000, his 2006 album Modern Times reached the US chart at #1, as did his 2009 album Together Through Life, in the US, Britain, France and several other countries. His 2012 album Tempest was also critically acclaimed. Since 1988, Dylan has been on the so-called Never Ending Tour, during which his performanes have provoked controversy, with some critics claiming that his lyrics have become incomprehensible, an experience which is not helped by his tendency to change his set-list and vocals almost every performance.&#10;&#10;Bob Dylan&apos;s strong influence over the past few years is becoming even more prominent amongst a growing group of younger emerging artists such as George Ellias and Devendra Banhart. Dylan&apos;s early lyrics incorporated politics, social commentary, philosophy and literary influences, defying existing pop music conventions and appealing widely to the counterculture of the time. While expanding and personalizing musical styles, Dylan has shown steadfast devotion to traditions of American song, from folk and country/blues to rock and roll and rockabilly, to Gaelic balladry, even jazz, swing and Broadway.&#10;&#10;Dylan performs with the guitar, keyboard and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s. He has also recently performed alongside other iconic artists, such as Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Tom Petty and Eric Clapton. Although his contributions as a performer and recording artist have been central to his career, his songwriting is generally held as his highest accomplishment.  &#10;&#10;Nobel Prize for Literature (2016)  - On October 13, 2016, Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition”. The prestigious award has been given annually since 1901 and previous Nobel Laureates for Literature include Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett. Here is the speech written by Dylan, although unable to attend:&#10;http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/10/arts/bob-dylan-nobel-prize-acceptance-speech.html?_r=0&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Bob+Dylan&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>CocoRosie is an American duo formed in 2003 by sisters Bianca &quot;Coco&quot; and Sierra &quot;Rosie&quot; Casady. The sisters were born and raised in the United States (Sierra, the older of the two, was born in Iowa, and Bianca was born in Hawaii), but formed the band in Paris, France after meeting for the first time in years. Their mother nicknamed them Rosie and Coco, respectively, from which their musical act takes its name. Their music has been called freak folk, and incorporates elements of pop, blues, opera, electronica, and hip hop.&#10;CocoRosie began as a duo, with Sierra singing, playing the guitar, piano and harp, and Bianca singing and manipulating various children&apos;s toys, electronic and percussion instruments, as well as other exotic noisemakers. They subsequently added various backing musicians, usually a bassist, keyboardist, and beatboxer. They have been a very active touring group, playing across Europe, the United States, and elsewhere. &#10;They have released six full-length albums: La maison de mon rêve (2004),  Noah&apos;s Ark (2005),  The Adventures of Ghosthorse and Stillborn (2007),  Grey Oceans (2010), Tales of a GrassWidow (2013) and Heartache City (2015).&#10;&#10;In 2003, Bianca was growing restless and decided it was time for a change. Leaving her apartment in Brooklyn to travel the world, she ended up at Sierra&apos;s apartment in Paris. Over the course of the next two months, the women spent nearly every waking hour in Sierra&apos;s bathroom, chosen as the most acoustic and isolated room in the apartment. Soon, they had completed both a hip-hop recording (never released) called &quot;word to the crow&quot; and their proper debut album La Maison de Mon Rêve.&#10;&#10;Originally, La Maison de Mon Rêve was only intended to be distributed within a close circle of friends. However, by 2004 the lo-fi album had been released on independent label Touch and Go Records, who had obtained a copy of the CD and had uncharacteristically pursued signing the artists. Since the creation of their first album, the Casady sisters have been virtually inseparable.&#10;&#10;Stylistically they may be assigned to the indie rock, psychedelic folk, folktronica genres, and are sometimes associated with the New Weird America movement. Sierra, who studied operatic vocal techniques, takes the lead vocals and also plays guitar, harp and flute. Bianca is a percussionist and also beatboxes. The group also uses various objects such as toys to construct their unique sound. Popular indie bands such as The xx name them as a major influence.&#10;&#10;They were actively touring during most of 2004, playing across the U.S. and throughout Europe with artists such as TV on the Radio, Bright Eyes, Battles, Devendra Banhart, and Busdriver among others.&#10;&#10;Official website: http://www.cocorosiemusic.com &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/CocoRosie&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Lorenzo Aitken (22 April 1927 – 17 July 2005), better known by the stage name Laurel Aitken, was an influential Caribbean singer and one of the pioneers of Jamaican ska music. He is often referred to as the &quot;Godfather of Ska&quot;.&#10;&#10;Born in Cuba of mixed Cuban and Jamaican descent, Aitken and his family settled in Jamaica in 1938. After an early career working for the Jamaican Tourist Board singing mento songs for visitors arriving at Kingston Harbour, he became a popular nightclub entertainer. His first recordings in the late 1950s were mento tunes such as &quot;Nebuchnezer&quot;, &quot;Sweet Chariot&quot; (aka the gospel classic &quot;Swing Low, Sweet Chariot&quot;) and &quot;Baba Kill Me Goat&quot;. Aitken&apos;s 1958 single &quot;Boogie in My Bones&quot;/&quot;Little Sheila&quot; was one of the first records produced by Chris Blackwell and the first Jamaican popular music record to be released in the United Kingdom. Other more Jamaican rhythm and blues orientated singles from this period include &quot;Low Down Dirty Girl&quot; and &quot;More Whisky&quot; both produced by Duke Reid.&#10;&#10;Aitken moved to Brixton, London, in 1960 and recorded for the Blue Beat label, releasing fifteen singles before returning to Jamaica in 1963. He recorded for Duke Reid, with backing from the Skatalites on tracks such as &quot;Zion&quot; and &quot;Weary Wanderer&quot;, before returning to the UK, where he began working with Pama Records. He recorded hits such as &quot;Fire in Mi Wire&quot; and &quot;Landlord and Tenants&quot;, which led to a wider recognition outside of Jamaica and the UK. This cemented his position as one of ska&apos;s leading artists and earned him the nicknames The Godfather of Ska, and later Boss Skinhead. He gained a loyal following not only among the West Indian community, but also among mods, skinheads and other ska fans. He had hit records in the United Kingdom and other countries in the 1950s through to the 1970s on labels such as Blue Beat, Pama, Trojan, Rio, Dr. Bird, Nu-Beat, Ska-Beat,Hot Lead and Dice. Some of his singles featured B-sides credited to his brother, guitarist Bobby Aitken. Aitken also recorded a few talk-over/deejay tracks under the guise of &apos;King Horror&apos;, such as &quot;Loch Ness Monster&quot;, &quot;Dracula, Prince of Darkness&quot;, and &quot;The Hole&quot;. Aitken settled in Leicester with his wife in 1970. His output slowed in the 1970s and during this period he worked as an entertainer in nightclubs and restaurants in the area including the popular &apos;Costa Brava Restaurant&apos; in Leicester under his real name Lorenzo. In 1980, with ska enjoying a resurgence in the wake of the 2 Tone movement, Aitken had his only success in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Rudi Got Married&quot; (#60) released on I-Spy Records (the label created and managed by Secret Affair. Aitken&apos;s career took in mento/calypso, R&amp;B, ska, rock steady, and reggae, and in the 1990s he even turned his talents to dancehall. He performed occasional concerts almost until his death from a heart attack in 2005. After a long campaign, a blue plaque in his honour was put up at his Leicester home in 2007. Punk band Rancid cover&apos;s Aitken&apos;s Everybody Suffering on their 2014 LP Honor Is All We Know&#10;&#10;&#10;Laurel Aitken (April 22, 1927 - July 17, 2005) became famous as one of the originators of Jamaican ska music in the late 1950s.&#10;&#10;Aitken was born as Lorenzo Aitken in Cuba, and is the brother of singer Bobby Aitken. He moved to England in the 1960s, and had a loyal following among Skinheads and other ska fans. He had massive hits in the 1950s through 1970s, while recording for Blue Beat Records, Pama Records and Trojan Records. He recorded one of the earliest ska records, the double A-sided Boogie in My Bones / Little Sheila (1958). It was the first record on producer Chris Blackwell&apos;s Island Records label.&#10;&#10;Aitken, who is known as &quot;The Godfather of Ska&quot;, made his home in Leicester UK and performed live almost until his death. He suffered from a serious illness following a heart attack about a year before he died. He died from a heart attack in Leicester, UK on July 17, 2005. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Laurel+Aitken&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Amon Tobin (born Amon Adonai Santos de Araújo Tobin on February 7, 1972) is a Brazilian musician, composer and producer of electronic music. He is described as a virtuoso sound designer and is considered to be one of the most influential electronic music artists in the world. He is noted for his unusual methodology in sound design and music production. He has released seven major studio albums under the London-based Ninja Tune record label.&#10;&#10;It began for him sometime in the mid-90s when, as a fresh-faced Brazilian ex-pat living in the UK, he decided he was going to put down his harmonica, pick up a sampler, and name himself after a Stephen King novel. The resulting album, Cujo&apos;s Adventures In Foam (released on Ninebar records, later reissued on Ninja Tune) signalled Amon Tobin&apos;s entry into the world of music.&#10;&#10;Immediately upon hearing this record, the powers that be at Ninja Tune signed him up to record as Amon Tobin, and he quickly went to work on his debut Bricolage. If you&apos;ll recall, these were the trip-hop years for electronic music, where any clown with a sampler and a collection of Blue Note records could knock off some half-baked boutique hotel background music. But Bricolage shone above all that. Although employing a marriage of jazz and beats, it stretched it further by bringing in elements of bossa-nova, batucada, and jungle, and combining it with a sense of song-writing that elevated it above the standards of that aforementioned scene. There is a song on it which was inspired by Amon urinating on his neighbor&apos;s bike after a domestic living dispute (One Day In My Garden)... this was clearly the no-good vibes-jazzy-beats guy Ninja had signed.&#10;&#10;Next up came Permutation. Although stylistically a logical follow up to Bricolage, it was also on this album where things starting taking a noticeable turn to a much darker output. In fact you can actually trace Amon&apos;s career based on coffee shop &amp; dinner party accessibility... and let&apos;s just say that this record signalled the end of anyone being able to use Amon records as background music. This one cut a wide path; from the film tributes of Like Regular Chickens &amp; People Like Frank, to the monster breaks on Sordid (easily his biggest &apos;hit&apos; in the catalog), to the caravan-esque shuffle of &quot;Nightlife,&quot; and ending with the ultra-lush Nova (which later was used for Bebel Gilberto&apos;s Samba Da Bencao on her debut album).&#10;&#10;Call it end of millennium tension, but while the rest of us were out stockpiling food for the apocalypse, Amon was channelling all that into his next release Supermodified. Treating it like if this was the end of the human race as we knew it and computers would never work again (or god forbid, if we were to be ruled by apes), then damn if he wasn&apos;t going make this banger before the lights went out. If Amon&apos;s career is a 4LP set, then this 3rd instalment appropriately comes off like the 3rd side of any 4LP 70s rock opus... a time to push some boundaries, challenge the fans a bit, and set the stage for what&apos;s to come later. The record was an experiment in sound. Marking the point where Amon became more and more obsessed with unheard but felt bass frequencies, and where he allowed a few collaborators into the mix (mainly Chris Morris of Brass Eye &amp; Blue Jam fame, and Montreal beatboxer Quadraceptor). The record where the Bossa-nova/jazz Amon Tobin was for the most part laid to rest and the dark/electronic/soundtrack Amon Tobin came into form. Four Ton Mantis is a classic, Deo would have done Sergio Leone proud, and Get Your Snack On paid tribute to one of the Internet&apos;s finest fake commercials. In 2002, Amon decided to relocate to Montreal. As Ninja Tune&apos;s North American headquarters is based there he&apos;d spent a lot of time soaking in the culture and summer sunshine of the city, never once thinking that he&apos;d never actually visited during the winter... &#10;&#10;Somewhere around the time he felt the sensation of his nose hairs freezing for the first time, so settled into his new studio armed with a fresh set-up and an A La Carte Express menu by his side (Montreal&apos;s bible of food for shut-ins) to put the finishing touches on Out From Out Where. When Sun Ra penned the song Out From Out There, &apos;there&apos; clearly meant outer space. When Amon decided to call his record Out From Out Where, the &apos;where&apos; meant just that... a record that came from somewhere nobody could quite pinpoint. This was the logical conclusion of what the previous records had hinted at. It was a cohesive and banging record, but one with no obvious reference points. It just sounded like Amon Tobin, and Amon (more so than a lot of artists) can actually say his sound is very much recognizable as his own. This was wide screen Amon, dropping the cut-up hip-hop of verbal, the Eli Wallach inspired Hey Blondie, the future electro-disco of Cosmo Retro Intro Outro, and the terrifying death march of Proper Hoodidge.  The tour for this album also resulted in Amon&apos;s entry into the Solid Steel mix series, with a tough ass Final Scratch DJ set captured in Australia released in June 2004.&#10;&#10;In early 2004 video game developers Ubisoft approached Amon and asked him to compose all of the music for the 3rd installment of their enormously popular Splinter Cell series. Seeing as he wasn&apos;t able to get past the second mission of the first Splinter Cell, he thought that making the soundtrack would clearly be an easier way to interact with the game. This was a chance for Amon to experiment with different ways of composing and to finally realize a teenage ambition (although this soundtrack in no way reflects his love for Galaga - even though that was a hot game). Composing a proper soundtrack also allowed him to be a little more progressively excessive, with the inclusion of extended string arrangements and over the top Hammond organ solos woven into his sounds. Italian prog sensation Goblin composing for a Bond film would be an apt comparison for this work. A love of soundtracks has always been a key influence in his work, and it clearly shows here. The game was released in 2005. An accompanying soundtrack on Ninja Tune was released in Jan 05. A 5.1 DVD-Audio version was released simultaneously with the game, putting Amon at the forefront, as always, of pushing sounds forward.&#10;&#10;Foley Room was released in 2007 and used the eponymous Foley Rooms at Ubisoft. Sound effects were recorded to create original sounds for the album rather than exclusively beat-sampling. The original concept was derived from an ambition to create an album based on &quot;sound&quot;. High-resolution bit samples, gated and distorted to produce similar wave patterns as purely synth-based music. Tracks further into the album include melodic instrument samples, notably The Kronos Quartet provide samples.&#10;&#10;Recent Activity:&#10;&#10;On September 8 2010, Esther&apos;s Video - directed by Charles De Meyer (aka Chuck Eklectric) was debuted on amontobin.com along with limited edition Monthly Joints Picture Disc vinyl as well as a package of Designer Sounds with Ableton files.&#10;&#10;On June 14, 2010 Amon Tobin released a free download of a 4 Deck Set recorded in Seattle in 2009. It is available on his website http://amontobin.com as a free download.&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Amon+Tobin&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

Back into the gaping maw of obscurity I go.  Tokyo is my last show with the Foxes.  Sorry if I was distant and obtuse if we ever met.  Have fun.&apos; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Fleet+Foxes&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Claudine Georgette Longet (born January 29, 1942 in Paris), was a popular singer and recording artist in the 1960s and 1970s. She was best known as the ex-wife of singer Andy Williams and later for being convicted of &quot;misdemeanor negligent homicide&quot; in the death of skiing star Spider Sabich.&#10;&#10;She was a dancer at the Folies Bergere in Las Vegas. and met Andy Williams when he pulled over to aid her on a desert road. They married on Christmas Day 1961 and had three children, Noelle, Christian and Robert. In 1968, she appeared in &quot;The Party&quot; with Peter Sellers and sang &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot; by Henry Mancini. Longet recorded a series of five MOR albums for A&amp;M Records between 1966 and 1970 and two albums for Williams&apos;s Barnaby label in 1971 and 1972. She also made frequent acting appearances in television series and appeared from time to time on Williams&apos; variety series and specials. Williams called Longet a beautiful, sleek brunette with large doe eyes, &quot;my favorite French singer&quot;. She and Williams separated in 1969 but did not divorce until 6 years later.&#10;&#10;Longet has never performed again after the criminal trial, and the Sabich family initiated civil proceedings to sue Longet. The case was eventually settled out of court for a large monetary settlement, with the proviso that Longet never tell or write about her story. They also demanded that Claudine withdraw from public circulation her recording of &quot;Bang Bang, My Baby Shot Me Down.&quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Claudine+Longet&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>There are at least two artists that have used this name:&#10;1. A roots reggae band from Jamaica&#10;2. A straight edge metalcore band from Florida, US&#10;&#10;1. Culture was a Jamaican roots reggae group founded in 1976. Originally they were known as the African Disciples.&#10;&#10;The members of the trio were Joseph Hill (lead vocals), Albert Walker (backing vocals) and Kenneth Dayes (backing vocals).&#10;&#10;Shortly after Culture came together, they began working with the &quot;Mighty Two&quot; – producer Joe Gibbs and engineer Errol Thompson. While at Gibbs’ studio, they recorded a series of powerful singles, many of which ended up on their debut album ‘Two Sevens Clash’. After their success with Gibbs, the group went on to make a string of albums for producer Sonia Pottinger. Culture began working with some of the premier musicians of the day including Robbie Shakespeare, Sly Dunbar, Ansel Collins, Cedric Brooks and the ever-present percussionist Sticky. Virgin Records picked up the albums, and that added distribution enabled Culture to gain an even larger following outside of Jamaica.&#10;&#10;Critically considered one of the most authentic traditional reggae acts, at the time of the first Rolling Stone Record Guide publication, they were the only band of any genre whose every recording received a five-star review (of bands with more than one recording in the guide).&#10;&#10;In 1982 the three singers went their own ways. Hill carried on using the Culture name, and recorded the Lion Rock album, which was released in the United States by Heartbeat Records. For their part, Walker and Dayes recorded a handful of songs on their own – a few of which turned up on an album titled Roots &amp; Culture. In 1986 the original line-up reformed to record two highly regarded albums – Culture in Culture and Culture at Work. These releases marked the beginning of a very busy period for the group, including annual albums and countless tours. The U.S. label Shanachie released a steady stream of new and old Culture albums up to Wings Of A Dove in 1992.&#10;&#10;Joseph Hill, who came to symbolize the face of Culture, died in Germany on 19 August 2006 while the group was on tour. His son, Kenyatta Hill, now is the lead singer.&#10;&#10;2) Classic mid/late 90s hardcore from Florida, celebrated for, among a handful of others, helping to cultivate the burgeoning metallic hardcore sound that became synonymous with the era.&#10;&#10;CULTURE was known for aggressive social/political/ecological commentary, cautionary tales of reckless consumerism and industrial sprawl, and advocacy of the straightedge lifestyle.&#10;&#10;Former members went on to Morning Again, Terror, As Friends Rust, Shai Hulud, Throwdown, Blood Has Been Shed and (most recently) ON BODIES.&#10;&#10;In 2012, CULTURE played its first show since disbanding in 1998 (The Reel &amp; Restless Fest in Miami, Florida). This fall, in August of 2013, the band will revisit Europe for Belgium&apos;s famed Ieper Hardcore Festival, and will then play three dates in Japan, including Tokyo&apos;s Bloodaxe Fest.&#10;&#10;Members included:&#10;&#10;Rich Thurston (Guitar: 1993-1997, Bass: 1993, Vocals: 1993, Drums: 1996)&#10;Josh Williams (Drums: 1993-1997)&#10;Stan Obal (Bass: 1993)&#10;Mark Mitchell (Vocals: 1993, Vocals: 1996)&#10;Pete Carreno (Bass: 1994)&#10;John Wylie (Guitar: 1994-1995)&#10;Damien Moyal (Vocals: 1994-1995, Vocals: 1997-1998)&#10;Gordon Tarpley (Bass: 1995-1997, Guitar: 1998)&#10;Louie Long (Vocals: 1995)&#10;Anthony Conte (Vocals: 1995)&#10;Steve Looker (Guitar: 1996-1997)&#10;Jason Dooley (Drums: 1997)&#10;Timothy Kirkpatrick (Drums: 1997-1998)&#10;Joe Simmons (Guitar:1997-1998)&#10;Floyd Beckham (Bass: 1998)&#10;Kenneth Brian (Guitar: 1998)&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Culture&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Naggo Morris&#10;Biography&#10;&#10;Naggo Morris, given name Dolphin George Morris.Born of Vernal Naggo Morris and Ivy Morris on September 30, 1947, in Carron Hall, St. Mary.  Moved to Kingston at two weeks old. Lived at Chisholm Ave for all his childhood years and into adulthood.  He is proud to mention that he attended Miss Allen’s school then Rousssea school at Ricketts Ave, Kingston 13.&#10;His dad was an avid musician/entertainer who at times made folks cried when he played his saxophone, so he fell in love with the entertainment business from observing him. He started out as a dancer with a group called the Coaster with Coupland Forbes, and Lenord Mundy. They worked with Luis Bennett and Ranny Williams on TV shows such as Sounds of the Seventies, Mambo Tam Boo, Ring Ding and Coozie Corner. They also did Christmas Morning shows at Carib Theatre, Regal Magestic Theatre and State Theatre in Kingston, Strand and Palladium Theatre  in Montego Bay. Fine start to life in the entertainment business especially working with the great Luis Bennett.&#10;Dancing was not enough for the multi talented Naggo Morris. He moved on to join a singing group called the Morwells,  then moved to the Royals with whom they did albums such as,  Pick up the Peices, and Conference Table. I also did some harmony for studio 1 recording studio with a group called the Soul Boys (Barrington Spence and Junior Zun).  They did a few songs for down beat/ studio one then moved to Treasure Isle recording studio where we worked along side Stranger Cole, Alton Ellis,  Slim Smith,  The Technique, The Unique and others.  He then went on to doing  a single called Say You (Adapted) for Prince Toney on the front line recording label. He also did vocals on an album called Rasta Ambassador with U-Roy who DJ. &#10; Some of his major hits were Here I Come with Clappas Record, the renowned Su Su Pan Rasta and Jah guide with Joe Gibbs and of course these were all number one hits on the charts. The riddim for Su Su Pan Rasta was so huge that Prince Far I did a song called Heavy Manner’s on it and which was a big hit too  He also did One Meal on the Joe Gibbs Label. During this time he  did backing vocals with Lloyd Parks of We the people band and Rudy Thomas May his soul rest in Peace.  Some of his most treasured moments were working alongside Dennis Brown,  Gregory Isaacs and Bob Andy with whom they produce multiple hit songs.&#10;In 1974 he did the hit song Flour Power which was inspired by cases of people being poisoned by flour contaminated with rat poison in Jamaica. This took the entertainment industry by storm and continues to be a well loved song.&#10;Being the very accomplished roots singer he was it wasno mistake when the Heptones recruited him to replace Leroy Sibbles after he migrated in 1975. His deep roots style perfectly complimented the Heptones (Earl Morgan, Barry Llewellyn) keen harmony As lead singer for the Heptones they were the first to grace the stages of  the first Reggae Sun Splash that came to Jarrett Park Montego bay. It was a real honor for him to be apart of such a momentous  event in the history of Jamaican reggae music. They opened the show billed with top artist such as Bob Marley, Ken Booth Alton Ellis and many others. It was the first performance but not the last. They also performed  in the 1982 at the Catherine Hall Bob Marley Center. &#10;The Heptones recorded a song for Channel one called, “How Could I Leave,” and others but Paulie(owner of channel) died and those songs weren’t released but played on dub plate.  Dennis Brown re-recorded the same song How Could I Leave on the Joe Gibbs label and it became number one.  Despite this the Heptones kept going. They  did an album  called , “Better Days” for Winston Niney Holliness  Boswell  then they went to England on tour in 1975. The Heptones toured Europe, Canada and the USA. One of Naggo’s  most treasured memory is visiting Scotland and seeing men wearing skirts with their bag pipes a big cultural difference.    &#10;He has worked with musicians such as Ansell Collins (key boards), Lloyd Park(Bass), Robbie Shaekespear(Bass), Sly Dunbar(drums), Frankie Bubbler (Organ), Ranchie McLean (guitarist), Ricka Backa (guitarist), Bongo Herman (percussion), Frank Aird aka Blazing Frank (trumpet), Vin Gordon (trombone), Deadly Headley( alto horns), &#10;My new album Everyday Life a Morris Must production will be out soon. Songs written by him, but four in combination with Vivia Morris, backing vocals Earl Morgan, Barringtong Llewellyn and Naggo lead vocalist. The album was arranged by The Heptones, Vivia Morris, Errol Morris and Mitchell Morris.&#10;He gives thanks to  Winston Holliness and Larry MacDonald  for producing most of his music.  Thanks to Earl Morgan and Barry Llewellyn for the opportunity to work with them . A special thank you to Roy Francis from the mixing lab studios.&#10;Naggo Morris continues to perform with the Heptones and to do solo acts. He is now making preparations for shows in Canada, USA, Europe and Brazil.&#10;&#10;For Booking and Reservations:&#10;Contact: Vivia Morris&#10; Manager:&#10;Telephone: 1-763-568-6067.&#10;E-Mail: viviamanda@hotmail.com&#10;Skype: vivia.morris&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Naggo+Morris&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>With the tragic murder of Hugh Mundell, who was shot and killed while sitting in a car with Junior Reid, reggae lost one of its most promising young performers. Mundell&apos;s 1978 debut album, Africa Must Be Free By 1983, produced by Augustus Pablo, in Jamaica remains a classic roots reggae recording. Mundell&apos;s singing style and soothing voice will lull you into tranquility if you let it. &#10;&#10;Mundell, the son of a prominent Jamaican lawyer, was still a teenager when he teamed with influential producer Joe Gibbs to record a still-unreleased single, &quot;&apos;Where Is Natty Dread.&quot; His first break came when he was hired as a DJ for Augustus Pablo&apos;s Rockers sound system. His debut single, &quot;Africa Must Be Free by 1983&quot;, produced by Augustus Pablo, was released in early 1978. Mundell also recorded several 12&quot; singles as Jah Levi. &#10;&#10;Mundell continued recording with Pablo. The albums Time &amp; Place and Blackman&apos;s Foundation followed shortly after, and then a few tracks for Prince Jammy were gathered together along with some of Lacksley Castell&apos;s, put on an album and called Jah Fire. &#10;&#10;Beginning in 1979, Mundell took over the production of his own recordings. He released his Mundell album on Greensleeves in 1982. He also produced the debut album, Speak the Truth, by &quot;Little&quot; Junior Reid, on Pablo&apos;s label, Rockers. &#10;&#10;In 1983 he became involved in an argument and was shot in the neck. Shortly afterwards, his posthumous album Arise was released. A dub version of Africa Must Be Free By 1983 was released in 1989 and then packaged with the original by Greensleeves and RAS, and then Makasound packaged Time &amp; Place and Blackman&apos;s Foundation together and released it as The Blessed Youth in 2003. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Hugh+Mundell&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Jamaican ska vocal group The Maytals became a reggae band 1971, renamed Toots and The Maytals with Frederick &quot;Toots&quot; Hibbert as front figure. The band got a Grammy award 2005 for the album True Love. Funky Kingston in early 70s is on Rolling Stone&apos;s list The Greatest Albums of All Time. Bass line in &apos;54-46 That&apos;s My Number&apos; is one of the most covered in pop music. &apos;Monkey Man&apos;, &apos;Pressure Drop&apos;, &apos;Bam Bam&apos;, etc, made them to favorites for the early skinhead movement of white working-class youth in UK.  &#10;- - -&#10;&#10;Toots and The Maytals  are from Kingston, Jamaica. It was the producer Byron Lee who 1971 renamed them Toots &amp; the Maytals. Frederick &quot;Toots&quot; Hibbert, the leader of the group and the lead singer, was born in May Pen in the Parish of Clarendon, Jamaica. He was the youngest of seven children. He grew up singing gospel music in a church choir, but moved to Kingston in 1961 at the age of sixteen.&#10;&#10;In Kingston, he met Henry &quot;Raleigh&quot; Gordon and Nathaniel &quot;Jerry&quot; McCarthy, forming a group whose early recordings were attributed to &quot;The Flames&quot; and, possibly, &quot;The Vikings&quot;. Having renamed the group the Maytals, the vocal trio recorded their first album, &quot;Never Grow Old - presenting the Maytals&quot;, for producer Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd at Studio One in 1962-63. With musical backing from Dodd&apos;s house band, the legendary Skatalites, the Maytals&apos; close-harmony gospel singing ensured instant success for the 1964 release, overshadowing Dodd&apos;s other up-and-coming gospel trio, The Wailers. The original album augmented by studio out-takes from the Studio One sessions was re-released by Heartbeat/Rounder Records in 1997, and is essential listening for Maytals and Skatalites fans.&#10;&#10;After staying at Studio One for about two years, the group moved on to do sessions for Prince Buster (released in 1974) before recording their second album produced by Byron Lee in 1965. However, the band&apos;s musical career was rudely interrupted in late 1966 when Hibbert was arrested and imprisoned on drug possession charges.&#10;&#10;Following Hibbert&apos;s release from jail towards the end of 1967, the band officially changed their name to Toots and the Maytals and began working with Chinese-Jamaican producer Leslie Kong, a collaboration which produced three classic albums and a string of hits throughout the late sixties and early seventies - &quot;Do the Reggay&quot;, a 1968 single widely credited with coining the word reggae, &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, &quot;54-46 was my number&quot; and &quot;Monkey Man&quot;, the group&apos;s first international hit in 1970. The group was featured in one of reggae&apos;s greatest breakthrough events - The Harder They Come, the 1972 film and soundtrack starring Jimmy Cliff.&#10;&#10;Following Kong&apos;s death in 1971, the group continued to record with Kong&apos;s former sound engineer, Warwick Lyn; produced by Lyn and Chris Blackwell of Island Records, the group released three best-selling albums, and enjoyed international hits with &quot;Funky Kingston&quot; in 1973 and &quot;Reggae Got Soul&quot; in 1976.&#10;&#10;Toots and the Maytals&apos; compositions would be given a second airing in 1978-80 during the reggae-punk and ska revival period in the UK, when the Specials included &quot;Monkey Man&quot; on their 1979 debut album and the Clash produced their version of &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, with other Maytals&apos; covers being recorded by Sublime. Having toured throughout the world for many years, Toots and the Maytals disbanded in the early 1980s, but reformed in the early 90s to continue touring and recording successfully.&#10;&#10;The band recently won the 2005 Grammy award for reggae for the album True Love, an album consisting of re-recorded versions of their classics alongside popular and legendary musicians such as Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, and Keith Richards, as well as popular artists today such as No Doubt, Ben Harper, The Roots, and Shaggy.&#10;&#10;They also contributed to the Easy Star All-Stars album &apos;Radiodread&apos; (a dub tribute to Radiohead&apos;s OK Computer). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Toots+and+The+Maytals&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Michelle Lynn Johnson officially changed her professional name from Me&apos;Shell NdegéOcello to simply Meshell Ndegeocello, with the release of her 2001 album, &quot;Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape&quot;.&#10;&#10;Meshell Ndegeocello (b. August 29, 1968) is a singer, bassist, and multi-instrumentalist. She was born Michelle Johnson to Army lieutenant (and saxophonist) father Jacques Johnson and her mother, Helen in Berlin, Germany.&#10;&#10;Raised in Washington, D.C., Meshell Suihailia Bashir Shakur (as she became known) adopted the surname Ndegeocello, which means &quot;free like a bird&quot;, while still in her teens. She has been hailed in the music press as a redeemer of soul music. Her music incorporates funk, soul, hip-hop, reggae, rock and jazz. She has been nominated for 9 Grammys. She has frequently toured with Lilith Fair.&#10;&#10;Ndegeocello honed her chops on the D.C. Go go circuit in the late 1980s before venturing out as a solo artist. She emerged as a recording artist in 1993 on Maverick Records/Sire Records with her debut, Plantation Lullabies. This recording presented a distinctly androgynous persona. Her music has been featured in a number of film soundtracks including How Stella Got Her Groove Back and Batman and Robin. She has also appeared on recordings by Basement Jaxx and The Blind Boys of Alabama, among others. Her biggest hit is a duet with John Cougar Mellencamp, a cover version of Van Morrison&apos;s &quot;Wild Night&quot;, which reached #3 on the Billboard charts.&#10;&#10;Her singles &quot;If That&apos;s Your Boyfriend (He Wasn&apos;t Last Night)&quot;, &quot;Leviticus: Faggot&quot;, and her cover of Bill Withers &quot;Who Is He and What Is He To You?&quot; have all charted in the Billboard top 20. She sang background vocals on the song &quot;I&apos;d Rather be Your Lover&quot; by Madonna, on her album &quot;Bedtime Stories.&quot;. She also sang with Chaka Khan on the single &quot;Never Miss the Water&quot;, as well as providing her typical solid bass skills.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Meshell+Ndegeocello&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Steven Paul &quot;Elliott&quot; Smith (August 6, 1969 – October 21, 2003) was an American songwriter and musician. Smith was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and resided for a significant portion of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he first gained popularity. His primary instrument was the guitar, but he was also proficient at piano, clarinet, bass, drums and harmonica. Smith had a distinctive vocal style characterized by his &quot;whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery&quot; and use of multi-tracking to create vocal harmonies.&#10;&#10;After playing in the rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994 with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars. In 1997 he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, included in the soundtrack for the film Good Will Hunting, was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category in 1997.&#10;&#10;Smith battled with depression, alcoholism and drug addiction for years, and these topics often appeared in his lyrics. At age 34, he died in Los Angeles, California from two stab wounds to the chest. The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, From a Basement on the Hill, which was released posthumously on October 19, 2004.&#10;&#10;Early life&#10;&#10;Steven Paul Smith was born at Clarkson Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska. His mother, Bunny Welch (née Bunny Kay Berryman), was a music teacher at an elementary school, and his father, Gary Smith, was a University of Nebraska medical student at the time. His parents divorced about a year later, and Smith moved with his mother to live in Duncanville, Texas. Much later in his life, Smith got a tattoo of a map of Texas on his upper arm and said, &quot;I didn&apos;t get it because I like Texas, kinda the opposite. But I won&apos;t forget about it although I&apos;m tempted to &apos;cause I don&apos;t like it there.&quot; Smith endured a difficult childhood and a troubled relationship with his stepfather Charlie. Smith reflected the impact of this part of his life in the lyrics of &quot;Some Song&quot;: &quot;Charlie beat you up week after week, and when you grow up you&apos;re going to be a freak.&quot; The name &quot;Charlie&quot; also appeared in the lyrics for &quot;Flowers for Charlie&quot; and &quot;No Confidence Man&quot;. The family was a part of the Community of Christ through much of Smith&apos;s childhood, but eventually began attending services at a local Methodist Church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him &quot;really scared of hell&quot;. In a 2001 interview, he stated, &quot;I don&apos;t necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But I have my own version of it&quot;. At the age of nine, Smith began playing the piano, and at ten began learning guitar on a small acoustic guitar bought for him by his father. At this age he also composed an original piano piece, &quot;Fantasy,&quot; which won him a prize at an arts festival. Many of the people on his mother&apos;s side of the family were non-professional musicians; his grandfather was a Dixieland drummer and his grandmother sang in a glee club.&#10;&#10;At 14, Smith moved from Texas to Portland, Oregon, to live with his father, who was then working as a psychiatrist. It was around this time that Smith first began trying drugs and alcohol with friends as well as experimenting with recording for the first time, borrowing a four-track recorder. During high school, Smith played clarinet in the school band and also played guitar, piano and sang in the bands Stranger Than Fiction, A Murder of Crows and The Greenhouse, billed as either Steven Smith or &quot;Johnny Panic&quot;. He graduated from Lincoln High School as a National Merit Scholar.&#10;&#10;After graduation, Steven Smith began calling himself &quot;Elliott&quot;, saying that he thought &quot;Steve&quot; sounded too much like a &quot;jock&quot; name, and that &quot;Steven&quot; sounded &quot;too bookish&quot;. Biographer S. R. Shutt speculates that it was either inspired by Elliott Avenue, a street that Smith had lived on in Portland, or that it was suggested by his then-girlfriend. A junior high acquaintance of Smith speculates that it was so as not to be confused with Steve Smith, the drummer of Journey.&#10;&#10;Heatmiser&#10;&#10;Smith graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1991 with a degree in philosophy and political science. &quot;Went straight through in four years,&quot; he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. &quot;I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn&apos;t want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, &apos;This is your one and only chance to go to college and you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.&apos; Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day.&quot; After he graduated he &quot;worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and legal theory.&quot; While at Hampshire, Smith formed the band Heatmiser with classmate Neil Gust. After graduating from Hampshire, the band added drummer Tony Lash and bassist Brandt Peterson and began performing around Portland in 1992. The group released the albums Dead Air (1993) and Cop and Speeder (1994) as well as the Yellow No. 5 EP (1994) on Frontier Records, and were then signed to Virgin Records to release what became their final album Mic City Sons (1996).&#10;&#10;Smith had begun his solo career while still in Heatmiser, and the success of his first two releases created distance and tension with his band. Heatmiser disbanded prior to Mic City Sons&apos; release, prompting Virgin to put the album out inauspiciously through its independent arm, Caroline Records. A clause in Heatmiser&apos;s record contract with Virgin meant that Smith was still bound to it as an individual. The contract was later bought-out by DreamWorks prior to the release of his album, XO.&#10;&#10;Roman Candle&#10;&#10;His first release, Roman Candle (1994), came about when Smith&apos;s girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of &quot;the most recent eight songs that [he’d] recorded on borrowed four-tracks and borrowed guitar&quot; to Cavity Search Records. Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was only expecting a deal for a seven-inch record. Regarding the record, Smith said &quot;I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular. [...] The thing is that album was really well-received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed Heatmiser unfortunately.&quot; Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: &quot;The idea of playing [my music] for people didn&apos;t occur to me... because at the time it was the Northwest – Mudhoney and Nirvana – and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off.&quot; The instrumentation of the recordings was primarily acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by brief electric guitar riffs or a small drum set played with brushes. Only the final track, an instrumental titled &quot;Kiwi Maddog 20/20&quot; (a reference to the bum wine MD 20/20), had full band instrumentation.&#10;&#10;Smith&apos;s debut solo performance was at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from Roman Candle were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set comprised of B-sides, Heatmiser tunes, and unreleased tracks. Soon after this performance, he was asked to open for Mary Lou Lord on a week-long U.S. tour. Several more short tours followed, and Smith helped her record one of his songs &quot;I Figured You Out&quot;, which he once called &quot;a stupid pop song [written] in about a minute&quot; that he discarded for &quot;[sounding] like the fucking Eagles.&quot;&#10;Elliott Smith and Either/Or&#10;&#10;In 1995, the self-titled album Elliott Smith was released on Kill Rock Stars; the record featured a similar style of recording to Roman Candle, but not without hints of growth and experimentation. Though the majority of the album was recorded by Smith alone, friend and Spinanes vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on &quot;St. Ides Heaven&quot;, and Heatmiser guitarist Neil Gust played guitar on &quot;Single File&quot;. Several songs made reference to drugs, but Smith explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being about drugs specifically. Looking back, Smith felt that the album&apos;s pervasive mood gave him &quot;a reputation for being a really dark, depressed person,&quot; and said that he later made a conscious move toward more diverse moods in his music.&#10;&#10;In 1996, filmmaker Jem Cohen recorded Smith playing acoustic songs for the short film Lucky Three: an Elliott Smith Portrait. Two of these songs would appear on his next album, Either/Or, another Kill Rock Stars release that came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing bass, drums, keyboards and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title was derived from the two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, which deals with such themes as existential despair, dread, death and God.&#10;&#10;By this time, Smith&apos;s already-heavy drinking was now being compounded with use of anti-depressants. At the end of the Either/Or tour, an intervention was staged by close friends of his in Chicago, but it proved ineffective.&#10;&#10;Miss Misery and the Oscars&#10;&#10;In 1996, Smith was tapped by director and fellow Portland resident Gus Van Sant to be a part of the soundtrack to his film, Good Will Hunting. Smith recorded an orchestral version of &quot;Between the Bars (Orchestral)&quot; with acclaimed composer Danny Elfman for the movie. Smith also contributed a new song, &quot;Miss Misery,&quot; and three other previously released tracks (&quot;No Name #3&quot;, from Roman Candle, and &quot;Angeles&quot; and &quot;Say Yes&quot;, from Either/Or). The film was a commercial and critical success, and Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for &quot;Miss Misery&quot;. Not eager to step into the limelight, he only agreed to perform the song at the ceremony after the producers informed him that his song would be played live that night — either by him or another musician of their choosing.&#10;&#10;On March 5, 1998, Smith made his network television debut on Late Night With Conan O&apos;Brien performing &quot;Miss Misery&quot; solo on acoustic guitar. A few days later, wearing a white suit, he played an abridged version of the song at the Oscars, accompanied by the house orchestra. James Horner and Will Jennings won the award that night for best song with &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; (sung by Celine Dion) from the film Titanic. Smith did not voice disappointment about not winning the award.&#10;&#10;Smith commented on the surrealism of the Oscars experience: &quot;That&apos;s exactly what it was, surreal... I enjoy performing almost as much as I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was a lot of people who didn&apos;t come to hear me play. I wouldn&apos;t want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day.&quot;&#10;XO and Figure 8&#10;&#10;In 1998, after the success of Either/Or and &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, Smith signed to a bigger independent record label, DreamWorks Records. Around the same time, Smith fell into depression, speaking openly of considering suicide, and on at least one occasion made a serious attempt at ending his own life. While in North Carolina, he became severely intoxicated and ran off a cliff. He landed on a tree, which badly impaled him but broke his fall. When questioned about his suicide attempt, he told an interviewer, &quot;Um, yeah – I jumped off a cliff. But it didn&apos;t work.&quot; Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which released Roman Candle), said about this time in Smith&apos;s life: &quot;I talked him out of thinking that he wanted to kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him.&quot; Smith&apos;s first release for DreamWorks was later that year. Titled XO, it was produced by the team of Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock. XO also contained some instrumentation from Los Angeles musicians Joey Waronker and Jon Brion. It contained a more full-sounding, baroque pop sound than any of his previous efforts, with songs featuring a horn section, Chamberlins and elaborate string arrangements and even a drum loop on the song &quot;Independence Day&quot;. His familiar double-tracked vocal and acoustic guitar style was still apparent. The album went on to peak at number 104 on the Billboard 200 and sold 400,000 copies (more than double that of each of his two Kill Rock Stars releases), becoming the best-selling release of his career. Smith&apos;s backing band during most of this period was the Portland-based group Quasi, consisting of former bandmate Sam Coomes on bass guitar and Coomes&apos;s ex-wife Janet Weiss on drums. Quasi also performed as the opening act at many shows on the tour, with Smith sometimes contributing bass, guitar or backing vocals. On October 17, 1998, Smith appeared on Saturday Night Live and performed &quot;Waltz #2.&quot; His backing band for this appearance was John Moen, Jon Brion, Rob Schnapf and Sam Coomes.&#10;&#10;In response to whether the change to a bigger record label would influence his creative control, Smith said: &quot;...sometimes people look at major labels as simply money-making machines, they&apos;re actually composed of individuals who are real people, and there&apos;s a part of them that needs to feel that part of their job is to put out good music.&quot; Smith also claimed in another interview that he never read his reviews for fear that they would interfere with his songwriting.&#10;&#10;Figure 8, which was released in 2000, featured the return of Rothrock, Schnapf, Brion, and Waronker, and was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in England. The album garnered generally positive reviews and peaked at number 99 on the Billboard 200. The album garnered praise for its power pop style and complex arrangements, described as creating a &quot;sweeping kaleidoscope of layered instruments and sonic textures.&quot; However, some reviewers felt that Smith&apos;s trademark dark and melancholy songwriting had lost some of its subtlety, with one reviewer likening some of the songs to &quot;the self-pitying complaints of an adolescent venting in his diary.&quot;&#10;&#10;Album art and promotional pictures showed Smith looking cleaned-up and put-together. An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, including television appearances on Late Night With Conan O&apos;Brien and The Late Show With David Letterman. However, Smith&apos;s condition began to deteriorate as he had become addicted to heroin either towards the end of or just after the Figure 8 tour.&#10;&#10;Final years and recording of From a Basement on the Hill&#10;&#10;A follow-up to Smith&apos;s 2000 album was originally planned to happen with Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded a substantial amount of music for the album, when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work up until that point. He later said: &quot;There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn&apos;t want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs.&quot; When Brion sent a bill for the abandoned sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer voiced what he believed to be intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith sent a message to the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell, a member of the band Goldenboy. McConnell told SPIN that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd (of The Flaming Lips) and Scott McPherson played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.&#10;&#10;One of the few highlights for Smith in 2001 was inclusion of his song &quot;Needle in the Hay&quot; in Wes Anderson&apos;s dark comedy The Royal Tenenbaums. The song plays during a suicide attempt. Smith was originally supposed to contribute a cover of The Beatles&apos; &quot;Hey Jude&quot; for the film, but when he failed to do so in time, Anderson had to use The Mutato Muzika Orchestra&apos;s version of the track instead. Anderson would later say that Smith &quot;was in a bad state&quot; at the time.&#10;&#10;Smith&apos;s live performances during 2001 and 2002 were infrequent, typically in the Pacific Northwest or Los Angeles. A review of his December 20, 2001 show at Portland&apos;s Crystal Ballroom stated concern over his appearance and performance: his hair was uncharacteristically greasy and long; his face was bearded and gaunt; and during his songs he exhibited alarming signs of &quot;memory-loss and butterfingers&quot;. The crowd would often have to shout out the lyrics (and in some cases, guitar chords) when Smith could not think of them.&#10;&#10;In the first of only three concerts performed in 2002, Smith co-headlined Northwestern University&apos;s &quot;A&amp;O Ball&quot; with Wilco on May 2 in Chicago. Smith&apos;s performance was described as &quot;undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician&quot; and an &quot;excruciating... nightmare&quot;. A reporter for the online magazine Glorious Noise made the statement &quot;...it would not surprise me at all if Elliott Smith ends up dead within a year.&quot;&#10;&#10;On November 25, 2002, Smith was involved in a brawl with the Los Angeles Police Department at a Flaming Lips/Beck concert. Smith later said he was defending a man he thought the police were harassing. Assuming that Smith was homeless, the officers allegedly beat and arrested him and his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba. The two spent the night in jail. Smith&apos;s hand and back were injured in the incident, causing him to cancel a number of shows. Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips and a friend of Smith&apos;s, stated concern over Smith&apos;s appearance and actions, saying that he &quot;saw a guy who had lost control of himself. He was needy, he was grumpy, he was everything you wouldn&apos;t want in a person. It&apos;s not like when you think of Keith Richards being pleasantly blissed out in the corner.&quot; Smith had attempted to go to rehab several times, but said he &quot;couldn&apos;t honestly do the first step... I couldn&apos;t say what you were supposed to say and mean it.&quot; In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center: &quot;What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you&apos;re on a drip bag, but the only thing that&apos;s in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I&apos;m not psychotic.&quot; After his 34th birthday on August 6, 2003, he gave up alcohol, caffeine, red meat, refined sugar and his longtime (sometimes abused) regimen of psychiatric medication. Director Mike Mills had been working with Smith during his final years and described Smith&apos;s troubles and apparent recovery: &quot;I gave the script to him, then he dropped off the face of the earth… He went through his whole crazy time, but by the time I was done with the film, he was making From a Basement on a Hill and I was shocked that he was actually making music.&quot; With things improving for Smith after several troubled years, he began experimenting with noise music and worked on his girlfriend Jennifer Chiba&apos;s iMac with the intent of learning how to record with computers, noting that it was the only method with which he was still unfamiliar. Smith jokingly labeled his experimental way of recording &quot;The California Frown&quot; (a play on the Beach Boys&apos; &quot;California Sound&quot;). He said of the songs: &quot;They&apos;re kind of more noisy with the pitch all distorted. Some are more acoustic, but there aren&apos;t too many like that. Lately I&apos;ve just been making up a lot of noise.&quot; He was also in the process of recording songs for the Thumbsucker soundtrack, including Big Star&apos;s &quot;Thirteen&quot;, and Cat Stevens&apos; &quot;Trouble&quot;. In August 2003, Suicide Squeeze Records put out a limited-edition vinyl single for &quot;Pretty (Ugly Before)&quot;, a song that Smith had been playing since the Figure 8 tour. Steve Hanft described the last six months of Smith&apos;s life as being &quot;like the light at the end of the tunnel&quot; and was convinced that Smith was clean and recovered.&#10;&#10;Death and reactions&#10;&#10;Elliott Smith died on October 21, 2003, at age 34 from two stab wounds to the chest. According to girlfriend Jennifer Chiba, with whom he was living at the time, the two were arguing, and she locked herself in the bathroom. Chiba heard him scream, and upon opening the door, saw Smith standing with a kitchen knife in his chest. She pulled the knife out, after which he collapsed and she called 911. Smith died in the hospital with the time of death listed as 1:36 p.m. While Smith&apos;s death was originally reported as a suicide, the official autopsy report released in December 2003 left open the question of possible homicide. A possible suicide note, written on a Post-it, read, &quot;I&apos;m so sorry—love, Elliott. God forgive me.&quot; According to Pitchfork, producer Larry Crane reported on his Tape Op message board that he had planned to help Smith mix his album in mid-November. Crane wrote: &quot;I hadn&apos;t talked to Elliott in over a year. His girlfriend, Jennifer, called me [last week] and asked if I&apos;d like to come to L.A. and help mix and finish [Smith&apos;s album]. I said yes, of course, and chatted with Elliott for the first time in ages. It seems surreal that he would call me to finish an album and then a week later kill himself. I talked to Jennifer this morning, who was obviously shattered and in tears, and she said, &apos;I don&apos;t understand, he was so healthy.&quot; The coroner&apos;s report revealed that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol were found in his system at the time of his death. The coroner did find anti-depressant and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder medications in his system, but at prescribed levels. With his death not being officially declared a suicide, a journalist noted that some have suspected foul play, but also that the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.&#10;&#10;Soon after his death, a fan memorial was initiated outside of Solutions Audio (4334 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California), the site at which the cover of the Figure 8 album was shot. Farewell messages to Smith were written on the wall, flowers were brought and photos, candles and empty bottles of alcohol mentioned in Smith&apos;s songs were left. The owner of Solutions has, as of April 2008, allowed the memorial to stand. Memorial concerts were held in several cities in America and England. A petition was soon put forth with intent to make part of the Silver Lake area a memorial park in Smith&apos;s honor. It received over 10,000 signatures, but no plans to go forth with the park have been announced. Another memorial is located inside Smith&apos;s former high school, Lincoln High, and was erected in July 2006.&#10;&#10;Since Smith&apos;s death, many musical acts have paid him tribute. Songs in tribute to, or about Smith have been released by Rilo Kiley (&quot;Ripchord&quot; and &quot;It Just Is&quot; on More Adventurous), Sparta (&quot;Bombs and Us&quot;), Ben Folds (&quot;Late&quot; on Songs for Silverman), Third Eye Blind (&quot;Elliott Smith&quot; on Symphony of Decay), Mary Lorson (&quot;Lonely Boy&quot; on Realistic), Rhett Miller (&quot;The Believer&quot; on The Believer), Earlimart (&quot;Heaven Adores You&quot; on Treble and Tremble), Pete Yorn (&quot;Bandstand in the Sky&quot; on Nightcrawler, a song jointly dedicated to Jeff Buckley), and Ginger Sling (&quot;Faith&quot; on the &quot;Room&quot; EP). Several tribute albums have been released since his death: To: Elliott From: Portland, Home to Oblivion: Elliott Smith Tribute, Remote Memory: A Tribute to Elliott Smith, A Tribute to Elliott Smith and The String Quartet Tribute to Elliott Smith.&#10;&#10;Posthumous releases&#10;&#10;From a Basement on the Hill, with almost four years in production, was released October 19, 2004 by ANTI- Records (a part of Epitaph Records). With Smith&apos;s family in control of his estate, they chose to bring in Rob Schnapf and Smith&apos;s ex-girlfriend Joanna Bolme to sort through and mix the album. Although predicted by Smith to be a double album (or a regular album with a &quot;bonus disc&quot;), it was released as a 15-track single album. Many of the darkest songs from the sessions (later leaked onto the Internet) were not included, such as &quot;True Love&quot; (which deals graphically with addiction and rehab), &quot;Abused&quot;, &quot;Stickman&quot; and &quot;Suicide Machine&quot; (a reworking of the Figure 8 era unreleased instrumental, &quot;Tiny Time Machine&quot;). It is rumored that it was the family&apos;s wishes not to have these songs on the record, as they had the final say in what should and should not be released. Reviews of the album were mostly very positive, but some were more critical; The Onion&apos;s A.V. Club wrote that &quot;the album he left behind turns out to be messy, complicated, and unquestionably not his defining work...the album still earns its place—not at the top, and unfortunately as a bookend—in a jarringly important body of work.&quot; Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing, a biography by Benjamin Nugent, was rushed to publication and hit stores shortly after From a Basement on the Hill, barely beyond the first anniversary of the musician&apos;s death. Smith&apos;s family, as well as Joanna Bolme, Jennifer Chiba, Neil Gust, Sam Coomes, and Janet Weiss, all declined to be interviewed and did not support the publication of the book. It contained interviews with Rob Schnapf, David McConnell, and Pete Krebs. The book received mixed reviews, with Publishers Weekly remarking that while &quot;Nugent manages to patch together the major beats of Smith&apos;s life, he can offer little meaningful insight&quot; and that Smith&apos;s fans &quot;will be disappointed by this short and shallow biography.&quot;&#10;&#10;On May 8, 2007, a posthumous two-disc compilation album entitled New Moon was released by Kill Rock Stars. The album contained 24 songs recorded by Smith between 1994 and 1997 during his tenure with the label. The songs consisted of demos, early versions, previously released b-sides and some unfinished tracks. In the U.S., the album debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week. The record received favorable reviews and was Metacritic&apos;s 16th best-reviewed album of 2007. A significant portion of the proceeds from album sales are to go to Outside In, a social service agency for low-income adults and homeless youth in Portland, Oregon.&#10;&#10;On October 25, 2007, a book titled Elliott Smith was released by Autumn de Wilde, which consists of photographs, handwritten lyrics and &quot;revealing talks with Smith&apos;s inner circle&quot;. De Wilde was responsible for the Figure 8 sleeve art, making a landmark and de facto Smith memorial of the Solutions Audio mural. A five-song CD featuring previously unreleased live recordings of Smith performing acoustically at Club Largo in Los Angeles was included in the release.&#10;&#10;Musical style and influences&#10;&#10;Smith respected and was inspired by many artists and styles, including U2, The Kinks, Elvis Costello, Motown and flamenco records, AC/DC, Scorpions, and Modest Mouse. Smith claimed to listen exclusively to select albums (such as The Marble Index by Nico) for months. Sean Croghan (a former roommate of Smith&apos;s and member of bands Jr. High and Crackerbash) said that Smith &quot;listened almost exclusively to slow jams&quot; in his senior year at college. Smith was also known to gain inspiration from novels, religion and philosophy. He liked classic literature, especially Samuel Beckett, T. S. Eliot, and Fyodor Dostoevsky (and other Russian novelists).&#10;&#10;Smith mentioned his admiration for Bob Dylan in several interviews, citing him as an early musical influence. He once commented: &quot;My father taught me how to play &quot;Don&apos;t Think Twice, It&apos;s All Right&quot;. I love Dylan&apos;s words, but even more than that, I love the fact that he loves words.&quot; Smith covered Dylan&apos;s &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot; several times in concert.&#10;&#10;Smith was a dedicated fan of The Beatles (as well as their solo projects), once noting that he had been listening to them frequently since he was about &quot;four years old&quot; and also claimed that hearing The White Album was his original inspiration to become a musician. In 1998, Smith recorded and contributed a cover of the Beatles song &quot;Because&quot; to the American Beauty soundtrack, which can be heard during the closing credits of the film. Although this was the only Beatles song that Smith ever officially released, he is known to have recorded at least one other (&quot;Revolution (Beatles Cover)&quot;, during the sessions for XO), and played many songs by both the band and the members&apos; solo projects at live concerts. &#10;&#10;Regarding his songwriting, Smith said: “The way I think about it is... I don&apos;t really think about it in terms of language, I think about it more like shapes. That&apos;s an interesting thing to talk about but it&apos;s difficult. I&apos;m really into chord changes. That was the thing that I liked when I was a kid. So, I&apos;m not like a... I don&apos;t make up &apos;a riff&apos; really. It&apos;s usually like... that sequence that has some implied melody in it or something like that.” Smith said that transitions were his favorite part of songs and that he preferred to write broader, more impressionistic music closer to pop rather than folk music. Smith compared his songs to stories or dreams, not purely confessional pieces that people could relate to. When asked about the dark nature of his songwriting and the cult following he was gaining, Smith said he felt it was merely a product of him writing songs that were strongly meaningful to him rather than anything contrived. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Elliott+Smith&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content> Malcolm John &quot;Mac&quot; Rebennack, Jr. (born November 21, 1940), better known by the stage name Dr. John (also Dr. John Creaux), is an American singer-songwriter, pianist and guitarist whose music combines blues, boogie woogie and rock and roll.  The winner of five Grammy awards, Rebennack was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by singer John Legend on Monday, March 14, 2011.&#10;&#10;Dr. John has been making his own idiosyncratic music since the 1960s. Along with Professor Longhair, Dr. John is heir to the rich New Orleans tradition. He is perhaps best known for &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot;, an international hit in 1973, reissued and used on soundtracks many times since.&#10;&#10;Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, his professional musical career began as a session musician in New Orleans in the 1950s. Early on he also played guitar and was often known as Mac Rebennack. He switched to the bass (&quot;the lowest time of my life&quot;), and then the piano after his index finger was nearly shot off protecting his bandmate and longtime friend Ronnie Barron. He gained fame beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with music that combined New Orleans-style rhythm and blues with psychedelic rock and stage shows that bordered on voodoo religious ceremonies, including elaborate costumes and headdress. For a time he was billed as Doctor John, The Night Tripper. The name &quot;Dr. John&quot; came from a legendary Louisiana voodoo practitioner from the start of the 19th century.&#10;&#10;Dr. John has also done vocals for Popeyes Chicken &amp; Biscuits&apos; &quot;Luv dat chicken...&quot; jingle, as well as the theme song (&quot;My Opinionation&quot;) for the early-1990s television sitcom Blossom. His movie credits include Martin Scorsese&apos;s documentary The Last Waltz (in which he joins The Band for a performance of his song &quot;Such a Night&quot;) and Blues Brothers 2000 (in which he joins the fictional band The Louisiana Gator Boys to perform the song &quot;New Orleans&quot;).  In the 2009 Disney film The Princess and the Frog, Dr. John sings the opening tune, &quot;Down in New Orleans&quot;.&#10;&#10;In January 2008 Mac Rebennack, Dr. John, was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame.&#10;&#10;&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+John&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

Their first few releases appeared on the Catalogue imprint and were lapped up by those seeking a way to wind down after a night of furious funking to the likes of Pepe Bradock and Daft Punk. &quot;Mundo&quot; has been licensed from Catalogue for the Wagram Music double CD, Paris Lounge. It sits comfortably (on a chaise longue) next to cuts from Llorca, Le Tone, Kojak, and Next Evidence. Tim &apos;Love&apos; Lee fans will be impressed by the way Sporto Kantes combine Latin and Afro-Cuban influences with modern breakbeat technology. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sporto+Kantes&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>There are 3 bands with the name Simon Says.  One is a hard rock band from California, and the other is a prog rock band from Sweden. Simon Says is also a band from Estonia, Narva. They&apos;re a metalcore band with nu metal influences.&#10;&#10;Simon Says (U.S.):&#10;Simon Says was formed by a group of California high schoolers (Matt Franks, Zac Diebels, and Mike Johnston) who got their start playing high school auditoriums around the state in the early 1990s. Adding bassist Mike Arrieta in 1995, the group self-released two records, which attracted the attention of manager Jeff Saltzman. Saltzman set them up with Cake&apos;s producer Mark Needham and got them signed to Hollywood Records in July 1998. In 1999, they released their major-label debut, Jump Start, which yielded two hit modern rock singles, and the follow-up Shut Your Breath added a third radio hit.&#10;&#10;In 2001, Simon Says left Hollywood Records over promotional issues and changed their name to Key to Arson; soon after, drummer Mike Johnston left the band, to be replaced by Dave &quot;Stixx&quot; Marich. In 2004, Key to Arson announced the completion of an album entitled Light &apos;Em Up, but by the end of the year the band had broken up.&#10;&#10;Simon Says (Sweden):&#10;Stockholm in the early 90&apos;s was throbbing with prog. Numerous bands played small clubs and pubs in Sweden&apos;s capital. Most attention was paid to Anekdoten, Änglagaard and Landberk. &#10;&#10;On the fringes of this underground movement there was a less known band called Egg. An unorthodox band: while sounding as harsh and brutal as both VdGG and Crimson, they still struggled to make their melodies as catchy as those of pop tune. &#10;&#10;Bass player of Egg at the time was Stefan Renström, who upon joining them immediately had sensed the band&apos;s potential. But when Stefan wanted to lead the band in a certain direction, a lot of friction surfaced. Furthermore, his personal life collapsed and Stefan, unhappily, left both the band and Stockholm to form a new outfit. &#10;&#10;Around Christmas &apos;93 he made contact with a then very young Daniel Fäldt, singer of experimental band Leifs Hyvel. Things were settled: Simon Says was to be a project with the two of them as the nucleus. &#10;&#10;In March &apos;94 Stefan and producer Kenneth Magnusson started planning Simon Says&apos; first album. In August 1995 Ceinwen was released, to mostly positive reviews. A live act was put together and Simon Says looked like they were growing into a band. After a few gigs, however, the project was put on ice Stefan wasn&apos;t happy with the way Simon Says sounded and when both he and Daniel moved they suddenly were too far away from each other to be able to continue anyhow. Daniel started studying philosophy, then drifted off to India and the Middle East for two long periods. Meanwhile, Stefan focused on his role as bass player in his other band, Wagnerian space rockers The Moor, with whom he cut Flux in 1996. &#10;&#10;So, while Daniel was studying sitar in India, Stefan and The Moor toured Europe with legendary singer/flute and sax player Nik Turner of Hawkwind. Then, in 2001, Stefan felt he had somehow written a new Simon Says album. Guitarist Jonas Hallberg, Stefan&apos;s stand-in on bass in The Moor, was recruited, as well as Mattias Jarlhed (from Valinor&apos;s Tree) who recorded the drum parts only four days after having been invited to join. &#10;&#10;After four weeks Paradise Square was finished and a deal with Galileo records was struck. The album was released in July 2002 and was met by everything between very good and rave reviews. But after eight months of sporadic rehearsals the band was shelved. Again. &#10;&#10;Stefan refused to give Simon Says up, though. In spite of a series of domestic problems culminating in a tragic divorce he dedicated every spare second to write and record new music. And so, the band has in the last years contributed to a series of Musea samplers while all the time working on the main project: the one about survival.

<summary>The Limp Twins are Will Holland (a.k.a quantic) and Russell Porter, who created their album tales from beyond the groove (TRUCD057, 2003) in their bedrooms (according to the cd cover). The record is a funky offering somewhere in between the sound of Will Holland&apos;s other projects, quantic and the quantic soul orchestra, but is definately more laid back. &#10;&#10;For more information on this project, check out quantic&apos;s website: about The Limp Twins. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/The+Limp+Twins&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

The record features guest appearances from Sylvian as well as Juice Aleem and encompasses elements of dark downtempo, quirky house, and minimal techno.&#10;&#10;Babilonia followed on London label Peacefrog in 2005, and added baroque pop and folk stylings. Vocal contributions come from Feist, Sylvian, and Yael Naïm. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Readymade+FC&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Curtis Ousley (February 7, 1934 – August 13, 1971), who performed under the stage name King Curtis, was an American saxophone virtuoso known for rhythm and blues, rock and roll, soul, blues, funk and soul jazz. Variously a bandleader, band member, and session musician, he was also a musical director and record producer. Adept at tenor, alto, and soprano saxophone, he was best known for his distinctive riffs and solos such as on The Coasters - Yakety Yak, which later became the inspiration for Boots Randolph&apos;s &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; and his own &quot;Memphis Soul Stew&quot;.&#10;&#10;Curtis Ousley was adopted, with his sister, Josephine Ousley Allen. They were raised together in Fort Worth, Texas. Ousley attended I.M. Terrell High School, and studied and performed music with schoolmate Ornette Coleman.&#10;&#10;Ousley started playing saxophone at the age of twelve in the Fort Worth area. He took interest in many musical genres including jazz, rhythm and blues, and popular music. As a student pursuing music, he turned down college scholarships in order to join the Lionel Hampton Band. During his time with Hampton, he was able to write and arrange music and learn guitar. In 1952 Curtis decided to move to New York and became a session musician, recording for such labels as Prestige, Enjoy, Capitol, and Atco. He recorded with Nat Adderley, Wynton Kelly, Buddy Holly, Waylon Jennings and Andy Williams.&#10;&#10;Stylistically, Curtis took inspiration from saxophonists Lester Young, Louis Jordan, Illinois Jacquet, Earl Bostic, and Gene Ammons. Known for his syncopated and percussive style, he was both versatile and powerful as a musician. He put together a group during his time as a session musician that included Richard Tee, Cornell Dupree, Jerry Jemmott, and Bernard Purdie.&#10;&#10;King Curtis enjoyed playing jazz and rhythm &amp; blues but decided he would make more money as a rhythm &amp; blues musician, stating in a 1971 interview with Charlie Gillet that &quot;I love the authentic rhythm &amp; blues more than anything, and I also like to live well.&quot; From the 1950s until the mid-1960s, he worked as a session player, recording under his own name and with others such as the Coasters, with whom he recorded &quot;Yakety Yak.&quot; Buddy Holly hired him for session work, during which they recorded &quot;Reminiscing.&quot; Holly wrote this song, but gave Curtis the songwriting credit for flying down to the session. His best-known singles from this period are &quot;Soul Twist&quot; and &quot;Soul Serenade.&quot; He provided backing on a number of songs for LaVern Baker, including her 1958 hit single &quot;I Cried a Tear&quot;, where his saxophone became &quot;a second voice&quot;.&#10;&#10;In 1965, he moved to Atlantic Records and recorded his most successful singles, &quot;Memphis Soul Stew&quot; and &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; (1967). He worked with The Coasters, led Aretha Franklin&apos;s backing band The Kingpins. The Kingpins opened for The Beatles during their 1965 performance at Shea Stadium. Curtis produced records, often working with Jerry Wexler and recorded for Groove Records during this period, including the Joe South song &quot;Games People Play&quot; with guitarist Duane Allman.&#10;&#10;In March 1971 he appeared with Aretha Franklin and The Kingpins at the Fillmore West, which resulted in two live albums: Aretha Live at Fillmore West, and Curtis&apos; own Live at Fillmore West. In July 1971, Curtis recorded saxophone solos on &quot;It&apos;s So Hard&quot; and &quot;I Don&apos;t Wanna Be a Soldier&quot; from John Lennon&apos;s Imagine. Along with The Rimshots, he recorded the original theme song for the 1971 hit television show, Soul Train, titled &quot;Hot Potatoes.&quot;&#10;&#10;Curtis was killed on August 13, 1971 when he was stabbed during an argument with a pair of drug dealers he discovered on the steps outside his Manhattan apartment. Curtis was attempting to carry an air conditioner into his apartment when Juan Montanez refused to move from the entrance. A fight ensued and Montanez stabbed Curtis. Curtis later died at Roosevelt Hospital. In March 1972, Montanez was sentenced to seven years for second-degree manslaughter, but was released in late 1977 for good behavior.&#10;&#10;On the day of Curtis&apos; funeral Atlantic Records closed their offices. Jesse Jackson administered the service and as the mourners filed in, Curtis&apos; band &apos;The Kingpins&apos; played &quot;Soul Serenade&quot;. Among those attending were Ousley&apos;s immediate family, including sister Josephine Ousley Allen, other family members, Aretha Franklin, Cissy Houston, Brook Benton and Duane Allman. Franklin sang the closing spiritual &quot;Never Grow Old&quot; and Stevie Wonder performed &quot;Abraham, Martin and John and now King Curtis&quot;.&#10;&#10;Curtis was subsequently buried in a red granite-fronted wall crypt in the &apos;West Gallery of Forsythia Court&apos; mausoleum at Pinelawn Memorial Park in Farmingdale, New York, the same cemetery that holds jazz greats Count Basie and John Coltrane.&#10;&#10;In 1970, a year before his death, Curtis won the Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance Grammy for &quot;Games People Play&quot;.&#10;&#10;Curtis was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 6, 2000.&#10;&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/King+Curtis&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>The Quantic Soul Orchestra is a live funk project initiated by Will Holland, aka Quantic, which eschews the use of samples in favour of a rawer &apos;70s sound. Considered one of the main acts in the modern funk movement.&#10;&#10;Releases&#10;- Stampede (2003)&#10;- Pushin&apos; On (2005)&#10;- I&apos;m Thankful (2006)&#10;- Tropidélico (2007)&#10;&#10;&quot;Putting something back&quot; is how Will Holland described the reason for starting The Quantic Soul Orchestra. Having released two succesful albums on Tru Thoughts under his Quantic guise - The 5th Exotic and Apricot Morning (which fused jazzy and breakbeat sounds), he felt his next musical adventure would be to focus on the album Stampede. The Quantic Soul Orchestra is a live project, strictly no samples allowed. Influenced by Mr Holland&apos;s love of the dusty funk 45&apos;s, he wanted to record and produce an album with creative and like minded musicians.&#10;&#10;With pop acts in the 2000s now using hip-hop beats (beats which are heavily influenced by funk records from the 70s) it was important for the QSO to make their sound rough, raw and real - it&apos;s definitely not Acid Jazz but has a deeper funk sound that shows that this music is well and truly alive in the new millennium. Their album Stampede was influenced by the many flamboyant (but often poor) musicians in the 70s who loved music for music&apos;s sake, who wanted to dance and make people dance.&#10;&#10;They are not trying to be retro and trendy, hence the cover version of 4 Hero&apos;s future soul anthem from 2002 Hold It Down. Sung in one take as vocalist Alice Russell warmed up before a recording session, it was decided that the original Holland penned instrumental should be replaced with this version. Ms Russell also lends her soulful voice to two other tracks on Stampede Something That&apos;s Real and Take Your Time, Change Your Mind. The other sung track finds John Hughes adding vocals (as well as some guitar and flute) to the classic QSO 7&quot; Super 8. The QSO also adds Afro Beat, Soul and Jazz influences to the Funk sound with musicians Dave Woodhouse (Clavinet, Rhodes and Trumpet), Damian Bell (Trombone), Antonia Pheulatos (String Arrangements and Violin), Lucy Holland (Saxophone), Richard Gibbs (Drums) and of course Will Holland himself (Guitars, Bass and Percussion) adding to the variety.&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/The+Quantic+Soul+Orchestra&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>There are at least two artists that have used this name:&#10;1. A roots reggae band from Jamaica&#10;2. A straight edge metalcore band from Florida, US&#10;&#10;1. Culture was a Jamaican roots reggae group founded in 1976. Originally they were known as the African Disciples.&#10;&#10;The members of the trio were Joseph Hill (lead vocals), Albert Walker (backing vocals) and Kenneth Dayes (backing vocals).&#10;&#10;Shortly after Culture came together, they began working with the &quot;Mighty Two&quot; – producer Joe Gibbs and engineer Errol Thompson. While at Gibbs’ studio, they recorded a series of powerful singles, many of which ended up on their debut album ‘Two Sevens Clash’. After their success with Gibbs, the group went on to make a string of albums for producer Sonia Pottinger. Culture began working with some of the premier musicians of the day including Robbie Shakespeare, Sly Dunbar, Ansel Collins, Cedric Brooks and the ever-present percussionist Sticky. Virgin Records picked up the albums, and that added distribution enabled Culture to gain an even larger following outside of Jamaica.&#10;&#10;Critically considered one of the most authentic traditional reggae acts, at the time of the first Rolling Stone Record Guide publication, they were the only band of any genre whose every recording received a five-star review (of bands with more than one recording in the guide).&#10;&#10;In 1982 the three singers went their own ways. Hill carried on using the Culture name, and recorded the Lion Rock album, which was released in the United States by Heartbeat Records. For their part, Walker and Dayes recorded a handful of songs on their own – a few of which turned up on an album titled Roots &amp; Culture. In 1986 the original line-up reformed to record two highly regarded albums – Culture in Culture and Culture at Work. These releases marked the beginning of a very busy period for the group, including annual albums and countless tours. The U.S. label Shanachie released a steady stream of new and old Culture albums up to Wings Of A Dove in 1992.&#10;&#10;Joseph Hill, who came to symbolize the face of Culture, died in Germany on 19 August 2006 while the group was on tour. His son, Kenyatta Hill, now is the lead singer.&#10;&#10;2) Classic mid/late 90s hardcore from Florida, celebrated for, among a handful of others, helping to cultivate the burgeoning metallic hardcore sound that became synonymous with the era.&#10;&#10;CULTURE was known for aggressive social/political/ecological commentary, cautionary tales of reckless consumerism and industrial sprawl, and advocacy of the straightedge lifestyle.&#10;&#10;Former members went on to Morning Again, Terror, As Friends Rust, Shai Hulud, Throwdown, Blood Has Been Shed and (most recently) ON BODIES.&#10;&#10;In 2012, CULTURE played its first show since disbanding in 1998 (The Reel &amp; Restless Fest in Miami, Florida). This fall, in August of 2013, the band will revisit Europe for Belgium&apos;s famed Ieper Hardcore Festival, and will then play three dates in Japan, including Tokyo&apos;s Bloodaxe Fest.&#10;&#10;Members included:&#10;&#10;Rich Thurston (Guitar: 1993-1997, Bass: 1993, Vocals: 1993, Drums: 1996)&#10;Josh Williams (Drums: 1993-1997)&#10;Stan Obal (Bass: 1993)&#10;Mark Mitchell (Vocals: 1993, Vocals: 1996)&#10;Pete Carreno (Bass: 1994)&#10;John Wylie (Guitar: 1994-1995)&#10;Damien Moyal (Vocals: 1994-1995, Vocals: 1997-1998)&#10;Gordon Tarpley (Bass: 1995-1997, Guitar: 1998)&#10;Louie Long (Vocals: 1995)&#10;Anthony Conte (Vocals: 1995)&#10;Steve Looker (Guitar: 1996-1997)&#10;Jason Dooley (Drums: 1997)&#10;Timothy Kirkpatrick (Drums: 1997-1998)&#10;Joe Simmons (Guitar:1997-1998)&#10;Floyd Beckham (Bass: 1998)&#10;Kenneth Brian (Guitar: 1998)&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Culture&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Naggo Morris&#10;Biography&#10;&#10;Naggo Morris, given name Dolphin George Morris.Born of Vernal Naggo Morris and Ivy Morris on September 30, 1947, in Carron Hall, St. Mary.  Moved to Kingston at two weeks old. Lived at Chisholm Ave for all his childhood years and into adulthood.  He is proud to mention that he attended Miss Allen’s school then Rousssea school at Ricketts Ave, Kingston 13.&#10;His dad was an avid musician/entertainer who at times made folks cried when he played his saxophone, so he fell in love with the entertainment business from observing him. He started out as a dancer with a group called the Coaster with Coupland Forbes, and Lenord Mundy. They worked with Luis Bennett and Ranny Williams on TV shows such as Sounds of the Seventies, Mambo Tam Boo, Ring Ding and Coozie Corner. They also did Christmas Morning shows at Carib Theatre, Regal Magestic Theatre and State Theatre in Kingston, Strand and Palladium Theatre  in Montego Bay. Fine start to life in the entertainment business especially working with the great Luis Bennett.&#10;Dancing was not enough for the multi talented Naggo Morris. He moved on to join a singing group called the Morwells,  then moved to the Royals with whom they did albums such as,  Pick up the Peices, and Conference Table. I also did some harmony for studio 1 recording studio with a group called the Soul Boys (Barrington Spence and Junior Zun).  They did a few songs for down beat/ studio one then moved to Treasure Isle recording studio where we worked along side Stranger Cole, Alton Ellis,  Slim Smith,  The Technique, The Unique and others.  He then went on to doing  a single called Say You (Adapted) for Prince Toney on the front line recording label. He also did vocals on an album called Rasta Ambassador with U-Roy who DJ. &#10; Some of his major hits were Here I Come with Clappas Record, the renowned Su Su Pan Rasta and Jah guide with Joe Gibbs and of course these were all number one hits on the charts. The riddim for Su Su Pan Rasta was so huge that Prince Far I did a song called Heavy Manner’s on it and which was a big hit too  He also did One Meal on the Joe Gibbs Label. During this time he  did backing vocals with Lloyd Parks of We the people band and Rudy Thomas May his soul rest in Peace.  Some of his most treasured moments were working alongside Dennis Brown,  Gregory Isaacs and Bob Andy with whom they produce multiple hit songs.&#10;In 1974 he did the hit song Flour Power which was inspired by cases of people being poisoned by flour contaminated with rat poison in Jamaica. This took the entertainment industry by storm and continues to be a well loved song.&#10;Being the very accomplished roots singer he was it wasno mistake when the Heptones recruited him to replace Leroy Sibbles after he migrated in 1975. His deep roots style perfectly complimented the Heptones (Earl Morgan, Barry Llewellyn) keen harmony As lead singer for the Heptones they were the first to grace the stages of  the first Reggae Sun Splash that came to Jarrett Park Montego bay. It was a real honor for him to be apart of such a momentous  event in the history of Jamaican reggae music. They opened the show billed with top artist such as Bob Marley, Ken Booth Alton Ellis and many others. It was the first performance but not the last. They also performed  in the 1982 at the Catherine Hall Bob Marley Center. &#10;The Heptones recorded a song for Channel one called, “How Could I Leave,” and others but Paulie(owner of channel) died and those songs weren’t released but played on dub plate.  Dennis Brown re-recorded the same song How Could I Leave on the Joe Gibbs label and it became number one.  Despite this the Heptones kept going. They  did an album  called , “Better Days” for Winston Niney Holliness  Boswell  then they went to England on tour in 1975. The Heptones toured Europe, Canada and the USA. One of Naggo’s  most treasured memory is visiting Scotland and seeing men wearing skirts with their bag pipes a big cultural difference.    &#10;He has worked with musicians such as Ansell Collins (key boards), Lloyd Park(Bass), Robbie Shaekespear(Bass), Sly Dunbar(drums), Frankie Bubbler (Organ), Ranchie McLean (guitarist), Ricka Backa (guitarist), Bongo Herman (percussion), Frank Aird aka Blazing Frank (trumpet), Vin Gordon (trombone), Deadly Headley( alto horns), &#10;My new album Everyday Life a Morris Must production will be out soon. Songs written by him, but four in combination with Vivia Morris, backing vocals Earl Morgan, Barringtong Llewellyn and Naggo lead vocalist. The album was arranged by The Heptones, Vivia Morris, Errol Morris and Mitchell Morris.&#10;He gives thanks to  Winston Holliness and Larry MacDonald  for producing most of his music.  Thanks to Earl Morgan and Barry Llewellyn for the opportunity to work with them . A special thank you to Roy Francis from the mixing lab studios.&#10;Naggo Morris continues to perform with the Heptones and to do solo acts. He is now making preparations for shows in Canada, USA, Europe and Brazil.&#10;&#10;For Booking and Reservations:&#10;Contact: Vivia Morris&#10; Manager:&#10;Telephone: 1-763-568-6067.&#10;E-Mail: viviamanda@hotmail.com&#10;Skype: vivia.morris&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Naggo+Morris&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>With the tragic murder of Hugh Mundell, who was shot and killed while sitting in a car with Junior Reid, reggae lost one of its most promising young performers. Mundell&apos;s 1978 debut album, Africa Must Be Free By 1983, produced by Augustus Pablo, in Jamaica remains a classic roots reggae recording. Mundell&apos;s singing style and soothing voice will lull you into tranquility if you let it. &#10;&#10;Mundell, the son of a prominent Jamaican lawyer, was still a teenager when he teamed with influential producer Joe Gibbs to record a still-unreleased single, &quot;&apos;Where Is Natty Dread.&quot; His first break came when he was hired as a DJ for Augustus Pablo&apos;s Rockers sound system. His debut single, &quot;Africa Must Be Free by 1983&quot;, produced by Augustus Pablo, was released in early 1978. Mundell also recorded several 12&quot; singles as Jah Levi. &#10;&#10;Mundell continued recording with Pablo. The albums Time &amp; Place and Blackman&apos;s Foundation followed shortly after, and then a few tracks for Prince Jammy were gathered together along with some of Lacksley Castell&apos;s, put on an album and called Jah Fire. &#10;&#10;Beginning in 1979, Mundell took over the production of his own recordings. He released his Mundell album on Greensleeves in 1982. He also produced the debut album, Speak the Truth, by &quot;Little&quot; Junior Reid, on Pablo&apos;s label, Rockers. &#10;&#10;In 1983 he became involved in an argument and was shot in the neck. Shortly afterwards, his posthumous album Arise was released. A dub version of Africa Must Be Free By 1983 was released in 1989 and then packaged with the original by Greensleeves and RAS, and then Makasound packaged Time &amp; Place and Blackman&apos;s Foundation together and released it as The Blessed Youth in 2003. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Hugh+Mundell&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Jamaican ska vocal group The Maytals became a reggae band 1971, renamed Toots and The Maytals with Frederick &quot;Toots&quot; Hibbert as front figure. The band got a Grammy award 2005 for the album True Love. Funky Kingston in early 70s is on Rolling Stone&apos;s list The Greatest Albums of All Time. Bass line in &apos;54-46 That&apos;s My Number&apos; is one of the most covered in pop music. &apos;Monkey Man&apos;, &apos;Pressure Drop&apos;, &apos;Bam Bam&apos;, etc, made them to favorites for the early skinhead movement of white working-class youth in UK.  &#10;- - -&#10;&#10;Toots and The Maytals  are from Kingston, Jamaica. It was the producer Byron Lee who 1971 renamed them Toots &amp; the Maytals. Frederick &quot;Toots&quot; Hibbert, the leader of the group and the lead singer, was born in May Pen in the Parish of Clarendon, Jamaica. He was the youngest of seven children. He grew up singing gospel music in a church choir, but moved to Kingston in 1961 at the age of sixteen.&#10;&#10;In Kingston, he met Henry &quot;Raleigh&quot; Gordon and Nathaniel &quot;Jerry&quot; McCarthy, forming a group whose early recordings were attributed to &quot;The Flames&quot; and, possibly, &quot;The Vikings&quot;. Having renamed the group the Maytals, the vocal trio recorded their first album, &quot;Never Grow Old - presenting the Maytals&quot;, for producer Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd at Studio One in 1962-63. With musical backing from Dodd&apos;s house band, the legendary Skatalites, the Maytals&apos; close-harmony gospel singing ensured instant success for the 1964 release, overshadowing Dodd&apos;s other up-and-coming gospel trio, The Wailers. The original album augmented by studio out-takes from the Studio One sessions was re-released by Heartbeat/Rounder Records in 1997, and is essential listening for Maytals and Skatalites fans.&#10;&#10;After staying at Studio One for about two years, the group moved on to do sessions for Prince Buster (released in 1974) before recording their second album produced by Byron Lee in 1965. However, the band&apos;s musical career was rudely interrupted in late 1966 when Hibbert was arrested and imprisoned on drug possession charges.&#10;&#10;Following Hibbert&apos;s release from jail towards the end of 1967, the band officially changed their name to Toots and the Maytals and began working with Chinese-Jamaican producer Leslie Kong, a collaboration which produced three classic albums and a string of hits throughout the late sixties and early seventies - &quot;Do the Reggay&quot;, a 1968 single widely credited with coining the word reggae, &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, &quot;54-46 was my number&quot; and &quot;Monkey Man&quot;, the group&apos;s first international hit in 1970. The group was featured in one of reggae&apos;s greatest breakthrough events - The Harder They Come, the 1972 film and soundtrack starring Jimmy Cliff.&#10;&#10;Following Kong&apos;s death in 1971, the group continued to record with Kong&apos;s former sound engineer, Warwick Lyn; produced by Lyn and Chris Blackwell of Island Records, the group released three best-selling albums, and enjoyed international hits with &quot;Funky Kingston&quot; in 1973 and &quot;Reggae Got Soul&quot; in 1976.&#10;&#10;Toots and the Maytals&apos; compositions would be given a second airing in 1978-80 during the reggae-punk and ska revival period in the UK, when the Specials included &quot;Monkey Man&quot; on their 1979 debut album and the Clash produced their version of &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, with other Maytals&apos; covers being recorded by Sublime. Having toured throughout the world for many years, Toots and the Maytals disbanded in the early 1980s, but reformed in the early 90s to continue touring and recording successfully.&#10;&#10;The band recently won the 2005 Grammy award for reggae for the album True Love, an album consisting of re-recorded versions of their classics alongside popular and legendary musicians such as Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, and Keith Richards, as well as popular artists today such as No Doubt, Ben Harper, The Roots, and Shaggy.&#10;&#10;They also contributed to the Easy Star All-Stars album &apos;Radiodread&apos; (a dub tribute to Radiohead&apos;s OK Computer). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Toots+and+The+Maytals&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Michelle Lynn Johnson officially changed her professional name from Me&apos;Shell NdegéOcello to simply Meshell Ndegeocello, with the release of her 2001 album, &quot;Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape&quot;.&#10;&#10;Meshell Ndegeocello (b. August 29, 1968) is a singer, bassist, and multi-instrumentalist. She was born Michelle Johnson to Army lieutenant (and saxophonist) father Jacques Johnson and her mother, Helen in Berlin, Germany.&#10;&#10;Raised in Washington, D.C., Meshell Suihailia Bashir Shakur (as she became known) adopted the surname Ndegeocello, which means &quot;free like a bird&quot;, while still in her teens. She has been hailed in the music press as a redeemer of soul music. Her music incorporates funk, soul, hip-hop, reggae, rock and jazz. She has been nominated for 9 Grammys. She has frequently toured with Lilith Fair.&#10;&#10;Ndegeocello honed her chops on the D.C. Go go circuit in the late 1980s before venturing out as a solo artist. She emerged as a recording artist in 1993 on Maverick Records/Sire Records with her debut, Plantation Lullabies. This recording presented a distinctly androgynous persona. Her music has been featured in a number of film soundtracks including How Stella Got Her Groove Back and Batman and Robin. She has also appeared on recordings by Basement Jaxx and The Blind Boys of Alabama, among others. Her biggest hit is a duet with John Cougar Mellencamp, a cover version of Van Morrison&apos;s &quot;Wild Night&quot;, which reached #3 on the Billboard charts.&#10;&#10;Her singles &quot;If That&apos;s Your Boyfriend (He Wasn&apos;t Last Night)&quot;, &quot;Leviticus: Faggot&quot;, and her cover of Bill Withers &quot;Who Is He and What Is He To You?&quot; have all charted in the Billboard top 20. She sang background vocals on the song &quot;I&apos;d Rather be Your Lover&quot; by Madonna, on her album &quot;Bedtime Stories.&quot;. She also sang with Chaka Khan on the single &quot;Never Miss the Water&quot;, as well as providing her typical solid bass skills.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Meshell+Ndegeocello&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Steven Paul &quot;Elliott&quot; Smith (August 6, 1969 – October 21, 2003) was an American songwriter and musician. Smith was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and resided for a significant portion of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he first gained popularity. His primary instrument was the guitar, but he was also proficient at piano, clarinet, bass, drums and harmonica. Smith had a distinctive vocal style characterized by his &quot;whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery&quot; and use of multi-tracking to create vocal harmonies.&#10;&#10;After playing in the rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994 with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars. In 1997 he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, included in the soundtrack for the film Good Will Hunting, was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category in 1997.&#10;&#10;Smith battled with depression, alcoholism and drug addiction for years, and these topics often appeared in his lyrics. At age 34, he died in Los Angeles, California from two stab wounds to the chest. The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, From a Basement on the Hill, which was released posthumously on October 19, 2004.&#10;&#10;Early life&#10;&#10;Steven Paul Smith was born at Clarkson Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska. His mother, Bunny Welch (née Bunny Kay Berryman), was a music teacher at an elementary school, and his father, Gary Smith, was a University of Nebraska medical student at the time. His parents divorced about a year later, and Smith moved with his mother to live in Duncanville, Texas. Much later in his life, Smith got a tattoo of a map of Texas on his upper arm and said, &quot;I didn&apos;t get it because I like Texas, kinda the opposite. But I won&apos;t forget about it although I&apos;m tempted to &apos;cause I don&apos;t like it there.&quot; Smith endured a difficult childhood and a troubled relationship with his stepfather Charlie. Smith reflected the impact of this part of his life in the lyrics of &quot;Some Song&quot;: &quot;Charlie beat you up week after week, and when you grow up you&apos;re going to be a freak.&quot; The name &quot;Charlie&quot; also appeared in the lyrics for &quot;Flowers for Charlie&quot; and &quot;No Confidence Man&quot;. The family was a part of the Community of Christ through much of Smith&apos;s childhood, but eventually began attending services at a local Methodist Church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him &quot;really scared of hell&quot;. In a 2001 interview, he stated, &quot;I don&apos;t necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But I have my own version of it&quot;. At the age of nine, Smith began playing the piano, and at ten began learning guitar on a small acoustic guitar bought for him by his father. At this age he also composed an original piano piece, &quot;Fantasy,&quot; which won him a prize at an arts festival. Many of the people on his mother&apos;s side of the family were non-professional musicians; his grandfather was a Dixieland drummer and his grandmother sang in a glee club.&#10;&#10;At 14, Smith moved from Texas to Portland, Oregon, to live with his father, who was then working as a psychiatrist. It was around this time that Smith first began trying drugs and alcohol with friends as well as experimenting with recording for the first time, borrowing a four-track recorder. During high school, Smith played clarinet in the school band and also played guitar, piano and sang in the bands Stranger Than Fiction, A Murder of Crows and The Greenhouse, billed as either Steven Smith or &quot;Johnny Panic&quot;. He graduated from Lincoln High School as a National Merit Scholar.&#10;&#10;After graduation, Steven Smith began calling himself &quot;Elliott&quot;, saying that he thought &quot;Steve&quot; sounded too much like a &quot;jock&quot; name, and that &quot;Steven&quot; sounded &quot;too bookish&quot;. Biographer S. R. Shutt speculates that it was either inspired by Elliott Avenue, a street that Smith had lived on in Portland, or that it was suggested by his then-girlfriend. A junior high acquaintance of Smith speculates that it was so as not to be confused with Steve Smith, the drummer of Journey.&#10;&#10;Heatmiser&#10;&#10;Smith graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1991 with a degree in philosophy and political science. &quot;Went straight through in four years,&quot; he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. &quot;I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn&apos;t want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, &apos;This is your one and only chance to go to college and you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.&apos; Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day.&quot; After he graduated he &quot;worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and legal theory.&quot; While at Hampshire, Smith formed the band Heatmiser with classmate Neil Gust. After graduating from Hampshire, the band added drummer Tony Lash and bassist Brandt Peterson and began performing around Portland in 1992. The group released the albums Dead Air (1993) and Cop and Speeder (1994) as well as the Yellow No. 5 EP (1994) on Frontier Records, and were then signed to Virgin Records to release what became their final album Mic City Sons (1996).&#10;&#10;Smith had begun his solo career while still in Heatmiser, and the success of his first two releases created distance and tension with his band. Heatmiser disbanded prior to Mic City Sons&apos; release, prompting Virgin to put the album out inauspiciously through its independent arm, Caroline Records. A clause in Heatmiser&apos;s record contract with Virgin meant that Smith was still bound to it as an individual. The contract was later bought-out by DreamWorks prior to the release of his album, XO.&#10;&#10;Roman Candle&#10;&#10;His first release, Roman Candle (1994), came about when Smith&apos;s girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of &quot;the most recent eight songs that [he’d] recorded on borrowed four-tracks and borrowed guitar&quot; to Cavity Search Records. Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was only expecting a deal for a seven-inch record. Regarding the record, Smith said &quot;I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular. [...] The thing is that album was really well-received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed Heatmiser unfortunately.&quot; Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: &quot;The idea of playing [my music] for people didn&apos;t occur to me... because at the time it was the Northwest – Mudhoney and Nirvana – and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off.&quot; The instrumentation of the recordings was primarily acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by brief electric guitar riffs or a small drum set played with brushes. Only the final track, an instrumental titled &quot;Kiwi Maddog 20/20&quot; (a reference to the bum wine MD 20/20), had full band instrumentation.&#10;&#10;Smith&apos;s debut solo performance was at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from Roman Candle were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set comprised of B-sides, Heatmiser tunes, and unreleased tracks. Soon after this performance, he was asked to open for Mary Lou Lord on a week-long U.S. tour. Several more short tours followed, and Smith helped her record one of his songs &quot;I Figured You Out&quot;, which he once called &quot;a stupid pop song [written] in about a minute&quot; that he discarded for &quot;[sounding] like the fucking Eagles.&quot;&#10;Elliott Smith and Either/Or&#10;&#10;In 1995, the self-titled album Elliott Smith was released on Kill Rock Stars; the record featured a similar style of recording to Roman Candle, but not without hints of growth and experimentation. Though the majority of the album was recorded by Smith alone, friend and Spinanes vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on &quot;St. Ides Heaven&quot;, and Heatmiser guitarist Neil Gust played guitar on &quot;Single File&quot;. Several songs made reference to drugs, but Smith explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being about drugs specifically. Looking back, Smith felt that the album&apos;s pervasive mood gave him &quot;a reputation for being a really dark, depressed person,&quot; and said that he later made a conscious move toward more diverse moods in his music.&#10;&#10;In 1996, filmmaker Jem Cohen recorded Smith playing acoustic songs for the short film Lucky Three: an Elliott Smith Portrait. Two of these songs would appear on his next album, Either/Or, another Kill Rock Stars release that came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing bass, drums, keyboards and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title was derived from the two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, which deals with such themes as existential despair, dread, death and God.&#10;&#10;By this time, Smith&apos;s already-heavy drinking was now being compounded with use of anti-depressants. At the end of the Either/Or tour, an intervention was staged by close friends of his in Chicago, but it proved ineffective.&#10;&#10;Miss Misery and the Oscars&#10;&#10;In 1996, Smith was tapped by director and fellow Portland resident Gus Van Sant to be a part of the soundtrack to his film, Good Will Hunting. Smith recorded an orchestral version of &quot;Between the Bars (Orchestral)&quot; with acclaimed composer Danny Elfman for the movie. Smith also contributed a new song, &quot;Miss Misery,&quot; and three other previously released tracks (&quot;No Name #3&quot;, from Roman Candle, and &quot;Angeles&quot; and &quot;Say Yes&quot;, from Either/Or). The film was a commercial and critical success, and Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for &quot;Miss Misery&quot;. Not eager to step into the limelight, he only agreed to perform the song at the ceremony after the producers informed him that his song would be played live that night — either by him or another musician of their choosing.&#10;&#10;On March 5, 1998, Smith made his network television debut on Late Night With Conan O&apos;Brien performing &quot;Miss Misery&quot; solo on acoustic guitar. A few days later, wearing a white suit, he played an abridged version of the song at the Oscars, accompanied by the house orchestra. James Horner and Will Jennings won the award that night for best song with &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; (sung by Celine Dion) from the film Titanic. Smith did not voice disappointment about not winning the award.&#10;&#10;Smith commented on the surrealism of the Oscars experience: &quot;That&apos;s exactly what it was, surreal... I enjoy performing almost as much as I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was a lot of people who didn&apos;t come to hear me play. I wouldn&apos;t want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day.&quot;&#10;XO and Figure 8&#10;&#10;In 1998, after the success of Either/Or and &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, Smith signed to a bigger independent record label, DreamWorks Records. Around the same time, Smith fell into depression, speaking openly of considering suicide, and on at least one occasion made a serious attempt at ending his own life. While in North Carolina, he became severely intoxicated and ran off a cliff. He landed on a tree, which badly impaled him but broke his fall. When questioned about his suicide attempt, he told an interviewer, &quot;Um, yeah – I jumped off a cliff. But it didn&apos;t work.&quot; Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which released Roman Candle), said about this time in Smith&apos;s life: &quot;I talked him out of thinking that he wanted to kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him.&quot; Smith&apos;s first release for DreamWorks was later that year. Titled XO, it was produced by the team of Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock. XO also contained some instrumentation from Los Angeles musicians Joey Waronker and Jon Brion. It contained a more full-sounding, baroque pop sound than any of his previous efforts, with songs featuring a horn section, Chamberlins and elaborate string arrangements and even a drum loop on the song &quot;Independence Day&quot;. His familiar double-tracked vocal and acoustic guitar style was still apparent. The album went on to peak at number 104 on the Billboard 200 and sold 400,000 copies (more than double that of each of his two Kill Rock Stars releases), becoming the best-selling release of his career. Smith&apos;s backing band during most of this period was the Portland-based group Quasi, consisting of former bandmate Sam Coomes on bass guitar and Coomes&apos;s ex-wife Janet Weiss on drums. Quasi also performed as the opening act at many shows on the tour, with Smith sometimes contributing bass, guitar or backing vocals. On October 17, 1998, Smith appeared on Saturday Night Live and performed &quot;Waltz #2.&quot; His backing band for this appearance was John Moen, Jon Brion, Rob Schnapf and Sam Coomes.&#10;&#10;In response to whether the change to a bigger record label would influence his creative control, Smith said: &quot;...sometimes people look at major labels as simply money-making machines, they&apos;re actually composed of individuals who are real people, and there&apos;s a part of them that needs to feel that part of their job is to put out good music.&quot; Smith also claimed in another interview that he never read his reviews for fear that they would interfere with his songwriting.&#10;&#10;Figure 8, which was released in 2000, featured the return of Rothrock, Schnapf, Brion, and Waronker, and was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in England. The album garnered generally positive reviews and peaked at number 99 on the Billboard 200. The album garnered praise for its power pop style and complex arrangements, described as creating a &quot;sweeping kaleidoscope of layered instruments and sonic textures.&quot; However, some reviewers felt that Smith&apos;s trademark dark and melancholy songwriting had lost some of its subtlety, with one reviewer likening some of the songs to &quot;the self-pitying complaints of an adolescent venting in his diary.&quot;&#10;&#10;Album art and promotional pictures showed Smith looking cleaned-up and put-together. An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, including television appearances on Late Night With Conan O&apos;Brien and The Late Show With David Letterman. However, Smith&apos;s condition began to deteriorate as he had become addicted to heroin either towards the end of or just after the Figure 8 tour.&#10;&#10;Final years and recording of From a Basement on the Hill&#10;&#10;A follow-up to Smith&apos;s 2000 album was originally planned to happen with Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded a substantial amount of music for the album, when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work up until that point. He later said: &quot;There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn&apos;t want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs.&quot; When Brion sent a bill for the abandoned sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer voiced what he believed to be intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith sent a message to the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell, a member of the band Goldenboy. McConnell told SPIN that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd (of The Flaming Lips) and Scott McPherson played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.&#10;&#10;One of the few highlights for Smith in 2001 was inclusion of his song &quot;Needle in the Hay&quot; in Wes Anderson&apos;s dark comedy The Royal Tenenbaums. The song plays during a suicide attempt. Smith was originally supposed to contribute a cover of The Beatles&apos; &quot;Hey Jude&quot; for the film, but when he failed to do so in time, Anderson had to use The Mutato Muzika Orchestra&apos;s version of the track instead. Anderson would later say that Smith &quot;was in a bad state&quot; at the time.&#10;&#10;Smith&apos;s live performances during 2001 and 2002 were infrequent, typically in the Pacific Northwest or Los Angeles. A review of his December 20, 2001 show at Portland&apos;s Crystal Ballroom stated concern over his appearance and performance: his hair was uncharacteristically greasy and long; his face was bearded and gaunt; and during his songs he exhibited alarming signs of &quot;memory-loss and butterfingers&quot;. The crowd would often have to shout out the lyrics (and in some cases, guitar chords) when Smith could not think of them.&#10;&#10;In the first of only three concerts performed in 2002, Smith co-headlined Northwestern University&apos;s &quot;A&amp;O Ball&quot; with Wilco on May 2 in Chicago. Smith&apos;s performance was described as &quot;undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician&quot; and an &quot;excruciating... nightmare&quot;. A reporter for the online magazine Glorious Noise made the statement &quot;...it would not surprise me at all if Elliott Smith ends up dead within a year.&quot;&#10;&#10;On November 25, 2002, Smith was involved in a brawl with the Los Angeles Police Department at a Flaming Lips/Beck concert. Smith later said he was defending a man he thought the police were harassing. Assuming that Smith was homeless, the officers allegedly beat and arrested him and his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba. The two spent the night in jail. Smith&apos;s hand and back were injured in the incident, causing him to cancel a number of shows. Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips and a friend of Smith&apos;s, stated concern over Smith&apos;s appearance and actions, saying that he &quot;saw a guy who had lost control of himself. He was needy, he was grumpy, he was everything you wouldn&apos;t want in a person. It&apos;s not like when you think of Keith Richards being pleasantly blissed out in the corner.&quot; Smith had attempted to go to rehab several times, but said he &quot;couldn&apos;t honestly do the first step... I couldn&apos;t say what you were supposed to say and mean it.&quot; In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center: &quot;What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you&apos;re on a drip bag, but the only thing that&apos;s in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I&apos;m not psychotic.&quot; After his 34th birthday on August 6, 2003, he gave up alcohol, caffeine, red meat, refined sugar and his longtime (sometimes abused) regimen of psychiatric medication. Director Mike Mills had been working with Smith during his final years and described Smith&apos;s troubles and apparent recovery: &quot;I gave the script to him, then he dropped off the face of the earth… He went through his whole crazy time, but by the time I was done with the film, he was making From a Basement on a Hill and I was shocked that he was actually making music.&quot; With things improving for Smith after several troubled years, he began experimenting with noise music and worked on his girlfriend Jennifer Chiba&apos;s iMac with the intent of learning how to record with computers, noting that it was the only method with which he was still unfamiliar. Smith jokingly labeled his experimental way of recording &quot;The California Frown&quot; (a play on the Beach Boys&apos; &quot;California Sound&quot;). He said of the songs: &quot;They&apos;re kind of more noisy with the pitch all distorted. Some are more acoustic, but there aren&apos;t too many like that. Lately I&apos;ve just been making up a lot of noise.&quot; He was also in the process of recording songs for the Thumbsucker soundtrack, including Big Star&apos;s &quot;Thirteen&quot;, and Cat Stevens&apos; &quot;Trouble&quot;. In August 2003, Suicide Squeeze Records put out a limited-edition vinyl single for &quot;Pretty (Ugly Before)&quot;, a song that Smith had been playing since the Figure 8 tour. Steve Hanft described the last six months of Smith&apos;s life as being &quot;like the light at the end of the tunnel&quot; and was convinced that Smith was clean and recovered.&#10;&#10;Death and reactions&#10;&#10;Elliott Smith died on October 21, 2003, at age 34 from two stab wounds to the chest. According to girlfriend Jennifer Chiba, with whom he was living at the time, the two were arguing, and she locked herself in the bathroom. Chiba heard him scream, and upon opening the door, saw Smith standing with a kitchen knife in his chest. She pulled the knife out, after which he collapsed and she called 911. Smith died in the hospital with the time of death listed as 1:36 p.m. While Smith&apos;s death was originally reported as a suicide, the official autopsy report released in December 2003 left open the question of possible homicide. A possible suicide note, written on a Post-it, read, &quot;I&apos;m so sorry—love, Elliott. God forgive me.&quot; According to Pitchfork, producer Larry Crane reported on his Tape Op message board that he had planned to help Smith mix his album in mid-November. Crane wrote: &quot;I hadn&apos;t talked to Elliott in over a year. His girlfriend, Jennifer, called me [last week] and asked if I&apos;d like to come to L.A. and help mix and finish [Smith&apos;s album]. I said yes, of course, and chatted with Elliott for the first time in ages. It seems surreal that he would call me to finish an album and then a week later kill himself. I talked to Jennifer this morning, who was obviously shattered and in tears, and she said, &apos;I don&apos;t understand, he was so healthy.&quot; The coroner&apos;s report revealed that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol were found in his system at the time of his death. The coroner did find anti-depressant and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder medications in his system, but at prescribed levels. With his death not being officially declared a suicide, a journalist noted that some have suspected foul play, but also that the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.&#10;&#10;Soon after his death, a fan memorial was initiated outside of Solutions Audio (4334 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California), the site at which the cover of the Figure 8 album was shot. Farewell messages to Smith were written on the wall, flowers were brought and photos, candles and empty bottles of alcohol mentioned in Smith&apos;s songs were left. The owner of Solutions has, as of April 2008, allowed the memorial to stand. Memorial concerts were held in several cities in America and England. A petition was soon put forth with intent to make part of the Silver Lake area a memorial park in Smith&apos;s honor. It received over 10,000 signatures, but no plans to go forth with the park have been announced. Another memorial is located inside Smith&apos;s former high school, Lincoln High, and was erected in July 2006.&#10;&#10;Since Smith&apos;s death, many musical acts have paid him tribute. Songs in tribute to, or about Smith have been released by Rilo Kiley (&quot;Ripchord&quot; and &quot;It Just Is&quot; on More Adventurous), Sparta (&quot;Bombs and Us&quot;), Ben Folds (&quot;Late&quot; on Songs for Silverman), Third Eye Blind (&quot;Elliott Smith&quot; on Symphony of Decay), Mary Lorson (&quot;Lonely Boy&quot; on Realistic), Rhett Miller (&quot;The Believer&quot; on The Believer), Earlimart (&quot;Heaven Adores You&quot; on Treble and Tremble), Pete Yorn (&quot;Bandstand in the Sky&quot; on Nightcrawler, a song jointly dedicated to Jeff Buckley), and Ginger Sling (&quot;Faith&quot; on the &quot;Room&quot; EP). Several tribute albums have been released since his death: To: Elliott From: Portland, Home to Oblivion: Elliott Smith Tribute, Remote Memory: A Tribute to Elliott Smith, A Tribute to Elliott Smith and The String Quartet Tribute to Elliott Smith.&#10;&#10;Posthumous releases&#10;&#10;From a Basement on the Hill, with almost four years in production, was released October 19, 2004 by ANTI- Records (a part of Epitaph Records). With Smith&apos;s family in control of his estate, they chose to bring in Rob Schnapf and Smith&apos;s ex-girlfriend Joanna Bolme to sort through and mix the album. Although predicted by Smith to be a double album (or a regular album with a &quot;bonus disc&quot;), it was released as a 15-track single album. Many of the darkest songs from the sessions (later leaked onto the Internet) were not included, such as &quot;True Love&quot; (which deals graphically with addiction and rehab), &quot;Abused&quot;, &quot;Stickman&quot; and &quot;Suicide Machine&quot; (a reworking of the Figure 8 era unreleased instrumental, &quot;Tiny Time Machine&quot;). It is rumored that it was the family&apos;s wishes not to have these songs on the record, as they had the final say in what should and should not be released. Reviews of the album were mostly very positive, but some were more critical; The Onion&apos;s A.V. Club wrote that &quot;the album he left behind turns out to be messy, complicated, and unquestionably not his defining work...the album still earns its place—not at the top, and unfortunately as a bookend—in a jarringly important body of work.&quot; Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing, a biography by Benjamin Nugent, was rushed to publication and hit stores shortly after From a Basement on the Hill, barely beyond the first anniversary of the musician&apos;s death. Smith&apos;s family, as well as Joanna Bolme, Jennifer Chiba, Neil Gust, Sam Coomes, and Janet Weiss, all declined to be interviewed and did not support the publication of the book. It contained interviews with Rob Schnapf, David McConnell, and Pete Krebs. The book received mixed reviews, with Publishers Weekly remarking that while &quot;Nugent manages to patch together the major beats of Smith&apos;s life, he can offer little meaningful insight&quot; and that Smith&apos;s fans &quot;will be disappointed by this short and shallow biography.&quot;&#10;&#10;On May 8, 2007, a posthumous two-disc compilation album entitled New Moon was released by Kill Rock Stars. The album contained 24 songs recorded by Smith between 1994 and 1997 during his tenure with the label. The songs consisted of demos, early versions, previously released b-sides and some unfinished tracks. In the U.S., the album debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week. The record received favorable reviews and was Metacritic&apos;s 16th best-reviewed album of 2007. A significant portion of the proceeds from album sales are to go to Outside In, a social service agency for low-income adults and homeless youth in Portland, Oregon.&#10;&#10;On October 25, 2007, a book titled Elliott Smith was released by Autumn de Wilde, which consists of photographs, handwritten lyrics and &quot;revealing talks with Smith&apos;s inner circle&quot;. De Wilde was responsible for the Figure 8 sleeve art, making a landmark and de facto Smith memorial of the Solutions Audio mural. A five-song CD featuring previously unreleased live recordings of Smith performing acoustically at Club Largo in Los Angeles was included in the release.&#10;&#10;Musical style and influences&#10;&#10;Smith respected and was inspired by many artists and styles, including U2, The Kinks, Elvis Costello, Motown and flamenco records, AC/DC, Scorpions, and Modest Mouse. Smith claimed to listen exclusively to select albums (such as The Marble Index by Nico) for months. Sean Croghan (a former roommate of Smith&apos;s and member of bands Jr. High and Crackerbash) said that Smith &quot;listened almost exclusively to slow jams&quot; in his senior year at college. Smith was also known to gain inspiration from novels, religion and philosophy. He liked classic literature, especially Samuel Beckett, T. S. Eliot, and Fyodor Dostoevsky (and other Russian novelists).&#10;&#10;Smith mentioned his admiration for Bob Dylan in several interviews, citing him as an early musical influence. He once commented: &quot;My father taught me how to play &quot;Don&apos;t Think Twice, It&apos;s All Right&quot;. I love Dylan&apos;s words, but even more than that, I love the fact that he loves words.&quot; Smith covered Dylan&apos;s &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot; several times in concert.&#10;&#10;Smith was a dedicated fan of The Beatles (as well as their solo projects), once noting that he had been listening to them frequently since he was about &quot;four years old&quot; and also claimed that hearing The White Album was his original inspiration to become a musician. In 1998, Smith recorded and contributed a cover of the Beatles song &quot;Because&quot; to the American Beauty soundtrack, which can be heard during the closing credits of the film. Although this was the only Beatles song that Smith ever officially released, he is known to have recorded at least one other (&quot;Revolution (Beatles Cover)&quot;, during the sessions for XO), and played many songs by both the band and the members&apos; solo projects at live concerts. &#10;&#10;Regarding his songwriting, Smith said: “The way I think about it is... I don&apos;t really think about it in terms of language, I think about it more like shapes. That&apos;s an interesting thing to talk about but it&apos;s difficult. I&apos;m really into chord changes. That was the thing that I liked when I was a kid. So, I&apos;m not like a... I don&apos;t make up &apos;a riff&apos; really. It&apos;s usually like... that sequence that has some implied melody in it or something like that.” Smith said that transitions were his favorite part of songs and that he preferred to write broader, more impressionistic music closer to pop rather than folk music. Smith compared his songs to stories or dreams, not purely confessional pieces that people could relate to. When asked about the dark nature of his songwriting and the cult following he was gaining, Smith said he felt it was merely a product of him writing songs that were strongly meaningful to him rather than anything contrived. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Elliott+Smith&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content> Malcolm John &quot;Mac&quot; Rebennack, Jr. (born November 21, 1940), better known by the stage name Dr. John (also Dr. John Creaux), is an American singer-songwriter, pianist and guitarist whose music combines blues, boogie woogie and rock and roll.  The winner of five Grammy awards, Rebennack was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by singer John Legend on Monday, March 14, 2011.&#10;&#10;Dr. John has been making his own idiosyncratic music since the 1960s. Along with Professor Longhair, Dr. John is heir to the rich New Orleans tradition. He is perhaps best known for &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot;, an international hit in 1973, reissued and used on soundtracks many times since.&#10;&#10;Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, his professional musical career began as a session musician in New Orleans in the 1950s. Early on he also played guitar and was often known as Mac Rebennack. He switched to the bass (&quot;the lowest time of my life&quot;), and then the piano after his index finger was nearly shot off protecting his bandmate and longtime friend Ronnie Barron. He gained fame beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with music that combined New Orleans-style rhythm and blues with psychedelic rock and stage shows that bordered on voodoo religious ceremonies, including elaborate costumes and headdress. For a time he was billed as Doctor John, The Night Tripper. The name &quot;Dr. John&quot; came from a legendary Louisiana voodoo practitioner from the start of the 19th century.&#10;&#10;Dr. John has also done vocals for Popeyes Chicken &amp; Biscuits&apos; &quot;Luv dat chicken...&quot; jingle, as well as the theme song (&quot;My Opinionation&quot;) for the early-1990s television sitcom Blossom. His movie credits include Martin Scorsese&apos;s documentary The Last Waltz (in which he joins The Band for a performance of his song &quot;Such a Night&quot;) and Blues Brothers 2000 (in which he joins the fictional band The Louisiana Gator Boys to perform the song &quot;New Orleans&quot;).  In the 2009 Disney film The Princess and the Frog, Dr. John sings the opening tune, &quot;Down in New Orleans&quot;.&#10;&#10;In January 2008 Mac Rebennack, Dr. John, was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame.&#10;&#10;&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+John&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

Their first few releases appeared on the Catalogue imprint and were lapped up by those seeking a way to wind down after a night of furious funking to the likes of Pepe Bradock and Daft Punk. &quot;Mundo&quot; has been licensed from Catalogue for the Wagram Music double CD, Paris Lounge. It sits comfortably (on a chaise longue) next to cuts from Llorca, Le Tone, Kojak, and Next Evidence. Tim &apos;Love&apos; Lee fans will be impressed by the way Sporto Kantes combine Latin and Afro-Cuban influences with modern breakbeat technology. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sporto+Kantes&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>There are 3 bands with the name Simon Says.  One is a hard rock band from California, and the other is a prog rock band from Sweden. Simon Says is also a band from Estonia, Narva. They&apos;re a metalcore band with nu metal influences.&#10;&#10;Simon Says (U.S.):&#10;Simon Says was formed by a group of California high schoolers (Matt Franks, Zac Diebels, and Mike Johnston) who got their start playing high school auditoriums around the state in the early 1990s. Adding bassist Mike Arrieta in 1995, the group self-released two records, which attracted the attention of manager Jeff Saltzman. Saltzman set them up with Cake&apos;s producer Mark Needham and got them signed to Hollywood Records in July 1998. In 1999, they released their major-label debut, Jump Start, which yielded two hit modern rock singles, and the follow-up Shut Your Breath added a third radio hit.&#10;&#10;In 2001, Simon Says left Hollywood Records over promotional issues and changed their name to Key to Arson; soon after, drummer Mike Johnston left the band, to be replaced by Dave &quot;Stixx&quot; Marich. In 2004, Key to Arson announced the completion of an album entitled Light &apos;Em Up, but by the end of the year the band had broken up.&#10;&#10;Simon Says (Sweden):&#10;Stockholm in the early 90&apos;s was throbbing with prog. Numerous bands played small clubs and pubs in Sweden&apos;s capital. Most attention was paid to Anekdoten, Änglagaard and Landberk. &#10;&#10;On the fringes of this underground movement there was a less known band called Egg. An unorthodox band: while sounding as harsh and brutal as both VdGG and Crimson, they still struggled to make their melodies as catchy as those of pop tune. &#10;&#10;Bass player of Egg at the time was Stefan Renström, who upon joining them immediately had sensed the band&apos;s potential. But when Stefan wanted to lead the band in a certain direction, a lot of friction surfaced. Furthermore, his personal life collapsed and Stefan, unhappily, left both the band and Stockholm to form a new outfit. &#10;&#10;Around Christmas &apos;93 he made contact with a then very young Daniel Fäldt, singer of experimental band Leifs Hyvel. Things were settled: Simon Says was to be a project with the two of them as the nucleus. &#10;&#10;In March &apos;94 Stefan and producer Kenneth Magnusson started planning Simon Says&apos; first album. In August 1995 Ceinwen was released, to mostly positive reviews. A live act was put together and Simon Says looked like they were growing into a band. After a few gigs, however, the project was put on ice Stefan wasn&apos;t happy with the way Simon Says sounded and when both he and Daniel moved they suddenly were too far away from each other to be able to continue anyhow. Daniel started studying philosophy, then drifted off to India and the Middle East for two long periods. Meanwhile, Stefan focused on his role as bass player in his other band, Wagnerian space rockers The Moor, with whom he cut Flux in 1996. &#10;&#10;So, while Daniel was studying sitar in India, Stefan and The Moor toured Europe with legendary singer/flute and sax player Nik Turner of Hawkwind. Then, in 2001, Stefan felt he had somehow written a new Simon Says album. Guitarist Jonas Hallberg, Stefan&apos;s stand-in on bass in The Moor, was recruited, as well as Mattias Jarlhed (from Valinor&apos;s Tree) who recorded the drum parts only four days after having been invited to join. &#10;&#10;After four weeks Paradise Square was finished and a deal with Galileo records was struck. The album was released in July 2002 and was met by everything between very good and rave reviews. But after eight months of sporadic rehearsals the band was shelved. Again. &#10;&#10;Stefan refused to give Simon Says up, though. In spite of a series of domestic problems culminating in a tragic divorce he dedicated every spare second to write and record new music. And so, the band has in the last years contributed to a series of Musea samplers while all the time working on the main project: the one about survival. Tardigrade. &#10;&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Says&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<summary>The Limp Twins are Will Holland (a.k.a quantic) and Russell Porter, who created their album tales from beyond the groove (TRUCD057, 2003) in their bedrooms (according to the cd cover). The record is a funky offering somewhere in between the sound of Will Holland&apos;s other projects, quantic and the quantic soul orchestra, but is definately more laid back. &#10;&#10;For more information on this project, check out quantic&apos;s website: about The Limp Twins. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/The+Limp+Twins&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

The record features guest appearances from Sylvian as well as Juice Aleem and encompasses elements of dark downtempo, quirky house, and minimal techno.&#10;&#10;Babilonia followed on London label Peacefrog in 2005, and added baroque pop and folk stylings. Vocal contributions come from Feist, Sylvian, and Yael Naïm. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Readymade+FC&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Curtis Ousley (February 7, 1934 – August 13, 1971), who performed under the stage name King Curtis, was an American saxophone virtuoso known for rhythm and blues, rock and roll, soul, blues, funk and soul jazz. Variously a bandleader, band member, and session musician, he was also a musical director and record producer. Adept at tenor, alto, and soprano saxophone, he was best known for his distinctive riffs and solos such as on The Coasters - Yakety Yak, which later became the inspiration for Boots Randolph&apos;s &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; and his own &quot;Memphis Soul Stew&quot;.&#10;&#10;Curtis Ousley was adopted, with his sister, Josephine Ousley Allen. They were raised together in Fort Worth, Texas. Ousley attended I.M. Terrell High School, and studied and performed music with schoolmate Ornette Coleman.&#10;&#10;Ousley started playing saxophone at the age of twelve in the Fort Worth area. He took interest in many musical genres including jazz, rhythm and blues, and popular music. As a student pursuing music, he turned down college scholarships in order to join the Lionel Hampton Band. During his time with Hampton, he was able to write and arrange music and learn guitar. In 1952 Curtis decided to move to New York and became a session musician, recording for such labels as Prestige, Enjoy, Capitol, and Atco. He recorded with Nat Adderley, Wynton Kelly, Buddy Holly, Waylon Jennings and Andy Williams.&#10;&#10;Stylistically, Curtis took inspiration from saxophonists Lester Young, Louis Jordan, Illinois Jacquet, Earl Bostic, and Gene Ammons. Known for his syncopated and percussive style, he was both versatile and powerful as a musician. He put together a group during his time as a session musician that included Richard Tee, Cornell Dupree, Jerry Jemmott, and Bernard Purdie.&#10;&#10;King Curtis enjoyed playing jazz and rhythm &amp; blues but decided he would make more money as a rhythm &amp; blues musician, stating in a 1971 interview with Charlie Gillet that &quot;I love the authentic rhythm &amp; blues more than anything, and I also like to live well.&quot; From the 1950s until the mid-1960s, he worked as a session player, recording under his own name and with others such as the Coasters, with whom he recorded &quot;Yakety Yak.&quot; Buddy Holly hired him for session work, during which they recorded &quot;Reminiscing.&quot; Holly wrote this song, but gave Curtis the songwriting credit for flying down to the session. His best-known singles from this period are &quot;Soul Twist&quot; and &quot;Soul Serenade.&quot; He provided backing on a number of songs for LaVern Baker, including her 1958 hit single &quot;I Cried a Tear&quot;, where his saxophone became &quot;a second voice&quot;.&#10;&#10;In 1965, he moved to Atlantic Records and recorded his most successful singles, &quot;Memphis Soul Stew&quot; and &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; (1967). He worked with The Coasters, led Aretha Franklin&apos;s backing band The Kingpins. The Kingpins opened for The Beatles during their 1965 performance at Shea Stadium. Curtis produced records, often working with Jerry Wexler and recorded for Groove Records during this period, including the Joe South song &quot;Games People Play&quot; with guitarist Duane Allman.&#10;&#10;In March 1971 he appeared with Aretha Franklin and The Kingpins at the Fillmore West, which resulted in two live albums: Aretha Live at Fillmore West, and Curtis&apos; own Live at Fillmore West. In July 1971, Curtis recorded saxophone solos on &quot;It&apos;s So Hard&quot; and &quot;I Don&apos;t Wanna Be a Soldier&quot; from John Lennon&apos;s Imagine. Along with The Rimshots, he recorded the original theme song for the 1971 hit television show, Soul Train, titled &quot;Hot Potatoes.&quot;&#10;&#10;Curtis was killed on August 13, 1971 when he was stabbed during an argument with a pair of drug dealers he discovered on the steps outside his Manhattan apartment. Curtis was attempting to carry an air conditioner into his apartment when Juan Montanez refused to move from the entrance. A fight ensued and Montanez stabbed Curtis. Curtis later died at Roosevelt Hospital. In March 1972, Montanez was sentenced to seven years for second-degree manslaughter, but was released in late 1977 for good behavior.&#10;&#10;On the day of Curtis&apos; funeral Atlantic Records closed their offices. Jesse Jackson administered the service and as the mourners filed in, Curtis&apos; band &apos;The Kingpins&apos; played &quot;Soul Serenade&quot;. Among those attending were Ousley&apos;s immediate family, including sister Josephine Ousley Allen, other family members, Aretha Franklin, Cissy Houston, Brook Benton and Duane Allman. Franklin sang the closing spiritual &quot;Never Grow Old&quot; and Stevie Wonder performed &quot;Abraham, Martin and John and now King Curtis&quot;.&#10;&#10;Curtis was subsequently buried in a red granite-fronted wall crypt in the &apos;West Gallery of Forsythia Court&apos; mausoleum at Pinelawn Memorial Park in Farmingdale, New York, the same cemetery that holds jazz greats Count Basie and John Coltrane.&#10;&#10;In 1970, a year before his death, Curtis won the Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance Grammy for &quot;Games People Play&quot;.&#10;&#10;Curtis was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 6, 2000.&#10;&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/King+Curtis&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>The Quantic Soul Orchestra is a live funk project initiated by Will Holland, aka Quantic, which eschews the use of samples in favour of a rawer &apos;70s sound. Considered one of the main acts in the modern funk movement.&#10;&#10;Releases&#10;- Stampede (2003)&#10;- Pushin&apos; On (2005)&#10;- I&apos;m Thankful (2006)&#10;- Tropidélico (2007)&#10;&#10;&quot;Putting something back&quot; is how Will Holland described the reason for starting The Quantic Soul Orchestra. Having released two succesful albums on Tru Thoughts under his Quantic guise - The 5th Exotic and Apricot Morning (which fused jazzy and breakbeat sounds), he felt his next musical adventure would be to focus on the album Stampede. The Quantic Soul Orchestra is a live project, strictly no samples allowed. Influenced by Mr Holland&apos;s love of the dusty funk 45&apos;s, he wanted to record and produce an album with creative and like minded musicians.&#10;&#10;With pop acts in the 2000s now using hip-hop beats (beats which are heavily influenced by funk records from the 70s) it was important for the QSO to make their sound rough, raw and real - it&apos;s definitely not Acid Jazz but has a deeper funk sound that shows that this music is well and truly alive in the new millennium. Their album Stampede was influenced by the many flamboyant (but often poor) musicians in the 70s who loved music for music&apos;s sake, who wanted to dance and make people dance.&#10;&#10;They are not trying to be retro and trendy, hence the cover version of 4 Hero&apos;s future soul anthem from 2002 Hold It Down. Sung in one take as vocalist Alice Russell warmed up before a recording session, it was decided that the original Holland penned instrumental should be replaced with this version. Ms Russell also lends her soulful voice to two other tracks on Stampede Something That&apos;s Real and Take Your Time, Change Your Mind. The other sung track finds John Hughes adding vocals (as well as some guitar and flute) to the classic QSO 7&quot; Super 8. The QSO also adds Afro Beat, Soul and Jazz influences to the Funk sound with musicians Dave Woodhouse (Clavinet, Rhodes and Trumpet), Damian Bell (Trombone), Antonia Pheulatos (String Arrangements and Violin), Lucy Holland (Saxophone), Richard Gibbs (Drums) and of course Will Holland himself (Guitars, Bass and Percussion) adding to the variety.&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/The+Quantic+Soul+Orchestra&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

During his youth, his favorite singers were reggae legends Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer, musicians who strongly influenced his own style. Peter Tosh&apos;s influence can definitely be heard in Anthony B&apos;s vocal delivery and revolutionary stance.&#10;&#10;Anthony B adopted Rastafarian beliefs as a teenager, a decision which was not well-received by his family. The stubborn and determined Anthony B refused to give up his new religion and his dreadlocks and moved to the home of his aunt and uncle in the Kingston suburb, Portmore.&#10;&#10;While attending high school, Anthony B debuted as a deejay for the local sound system, Shaggy Hi-Power. In 1988, he befriended reggae artists such as Determine, Mega Banton, Ricky General and Terror Fabulous.&#10;&#10;At this point in the reggae industry, singing &quot;slack&quot; songs about women was the popular thing to do. Anthony B did not believe in degrading women and chose to pen politically-slanted songs rather than so-called &quot;gyal chunes.&quot; He hooked up with Little Devon the Half Pint sound-a-like singer he made his debut single &quot;The Living is Hard&quot; on the Wizard label in 1993. Anthony B tried many different producers but found that none of them fit his style of music. Finally, Anthony B teamed up with Richard &quot;Bello&quot; Bell, creating hits such as Fire Pon Rome, Raid Di Barn, Rumour, and Repentance Time. Anthony B&apos;s 1996 debut album Real Revolutionary was highly acclaimed in the reggae community. In late 1997, Anthony B released Universal Struggle which showed that Anthony B had a consistent, high-calibre talent. Anthony B has released a large number of albums since that time including 1999&apos;s Seven Seals and 2004&apos;s Untouchable which featured collaborations with artists including Wyclef Jean.&#10;&#10;Anthony B tours extensively in Europe and North America and is known for his fiery, high-energy performances.&#10;&#10;Anthony B is a member of the Bobo Ashanti branch of the Rastafarian movement. &quot;Bobo Dreads&quot;, as they are known, are recognizable by their long robes and turbans. The strong Afrocentric pride and the other Rastafarian beliefs (or &quot;overstandings&quot; as Rastafarians prefer to call them) which Anthony B holds are reflected in his songs.&#10;&#10;Discography&#10;&#10;    * Predator &amp; Prey (1996, Alpha Enterprises)&#10;    * Real Revolutionary / So Many Things (1996, Greensleeves)&#10;    * Universal Struggle (1997, VP Records)&#10;    * Seven Seals (1999, VP Records)&#10;    * That&apos;s Life (2001, VP Records)&#10;    * More Love (2001, AO !

<content>There are at least two artists that have used this name:&#10;1. A roots reggae band from Jamaica&#10;2. A straight edge metalcore band from Florida, US&#10;&#10;1. Culture was a Jamaican roots reggae group founded in 1976. Originally they were known as the African Disciples.&#10;&#10;The members of the trio were Joseph Hill (lead vocals), Albert Walker (backing vocals) and Kenneth Dayes (backing vocals).&#10;&#10;Shortly after Culture came together, they began working with the &quot;Mighty Two&quot; – producer Joe Gibbs and engineer Errol Thompson. While at Gibbs’ studio, they recorded a series of powerful singles, many of which ended up on their debut album ‘Two Sevens Clash’. After their success with Gibbs, the group went on to make a string of albums for producer Sonia Pottinger. Culture began working with some of the premier musicians of the day including Robbie Shakespeare, Sly Dunbar, Ansel Collins, Cedric Brooks and the ever-present percussionist Sticky. Virgin Records picked up the albums, and that added distribution enabled Culture to gain an even larger following outside of Jamaica.&#10;&#10;Critically considered one of the most authentic traditional reggae acts, at the time of the first Rolling Stone Record Guide publication, they were the only band of any genre whose every recording received a five-star review (of bands with more than one recording in the guide).&#10;&#10;In 1982 the three singers went their own ways. Hill carried on using the Culture name, and recorded the Lion Rock album, which was released in the United States by Heartbeat Records. For their part, Walker and Dayes recorded a handful of songs on their own – a few of which turned up on an album titled Roots &amp; Culture. In 1986 the original line-up reformed to record two highly regarded albums – Culture in Culture and Culture at Work. These releases marked the beginning of a very busy period for the group, including annual albums and countless tours. The U.S. label Shanachie released a steady stream of new and old Culture albums up to Wings Of A Dove in 1992.&#10;&#10;Joseph Hill, who came to symbolize the face of Culture, died in Germany on 19 August 2006 while the group was on tour. His son, Kenyatta Hill, now is the lead singer.&#10;&#10;2) Classic mid/late 90s hardcore from Florida, celebrated for, among a handful of others, helping to cultivate the burgeoning metallic hardcore sound that became synonymous with the era.&#10;&#10;CULTURE was known for aggressive social/political/ecological commentary, cautionary tales of reckless consumerism and industrial sprawl, and advocacy of the straightedge lifestyle.&#10;&#10;Former members went on to Morning Again, Terror, As Friends Rust, Shai Hulud, Throwdown, Blood Has Been Shed and (most recently) ON BODIES.&#10;&#10;In 2012, CULTURE played its first show since disbanding in 1998 (The Reel &amp; Restless Fest in Miami, Florida). This fall, in August of 2013, the band will revisit Europe for Belgium&apos;s famed Ieper Hardcore Festival, and will then play three dates in Japan, including Tokyo&apos;s Bloodaxe Fest.&#10;&#10;Members included:&#10;&#10;Rich Thurston (Guitar: 1993-1997, Bass: 1993, Vocals: 1993, Drums: 1996)&#10;Josh Williams (Drums: 1993-1997)&#10;Stan Obal (Bass: 1993)&#10;Mark Mitchell (Vocals: 1993, Vocals: 1996)&#10;Pete Carreno (Bass: 1994)&#10;John Wylie (Guitar: 1994-1995)&#10;Damien Moyal (Vocals: 1994-1995, Vocals: 1997-1998)&#10;Gordon Tarpley (Bass: 1995-1997, Guitar: 1998)&#10;Louie Long (Vocals: 1995)&#10;Anthony Conte (Vocals: 1995)&#10;Steve Looker (Guitar: 1996-1997)&#10;Jason Dooley (Drums: 1997)&#10;Timothy Kirkpatrick (Drums: 1997-1998)&#10;Joe Simmons (Guitar:1997-1998)&#10;Floyd Beckham (Bass: 1998)&#10;Kenneth Brian (Guitar: 1998)&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Culture&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Naggo Morris&#10;Biography&#10;&#10;Naggo Morris, given name Dolphin George Morris.Born of Vernal Naggo Morris and Ivy Morris on September 30, 1947, in Carron Hall, St. Mary.  Moved to Kingston at two weeks old. Lived at Chisholm Ave for all his childhood years and into adulthood.  He is proud to mention that he attended Miss Allen’s school then Rousssea school at Ricketts Ave, Kingston 13.&#10;His dad was an avid musician/entertainer who at times made folks cried when he played his saxophone, so he fell in love with the entertainment business from observing him. He started out as a dancer with a group called the Coaster with Coupland Forbes, and Lenord Mundy. They worked with Luis Bennett and Ranny Williams on TV shows such as Sounds of the Seventies, Mambo Tam Boo, Ring Ding and Coozie Corner. They also did Christmas Morning shows at Carib Theatre, Regal Magestic Theatre and State Theatre in Kingston, Strand and Palladium Theatre  in Montego Bay. Fine start to life in the entertainment business especially working with the great Luis Bennett.&#10;Dancing was not enough for the multi talented Naggo Morris. He moved on to join a singing group called the Morwells,  then moved to the Royals with whom they did albums such as,  Pick up the Peices, and Conference Table. I also did some harmony for studio 1 recording studio with a group called the Soul Boys (Barrington Spence and Junior Zun).  They did a few songs for down beat/ studio one then moved to Treasure Isle recording studio where we worked along side Stranger Cole, Alton Ellis,  Slim Smith,  The Technique, The Unique and others.  He then went on to doing  a single called Say You (Adapted) for Prince Toney on the front line recording label. He also did vocals on an album called Rasta Ambassador with U-Roy who DJ. &#10; Some of his major hits were Here I Come with Clappas Record, the renowned Su Su Pan Rasta and Jah guide with Joe Gibbs and of course these were all number one hits on the charts. The riddim for Su Su Pan Rasta was so huge that Prince Far I did a song called Heavy Manner’s on it and which was a big hit too  He also did One Meal on the Joe Gibbs Label. During this time he  did backing vocals with Lloyd Parks of We the people band and Rudy Thomas May his soul rest in Peace.  Some of his most treasured moments were working alongside Dennis Brown,  Gregory Isaacs and Bob Andy with whom they produce multiple hit songs.&#10;In 1974 he did the hit song Flour Power which was inspired by cases of people being poisoned by flour contaminated with rat poison in Jamaica. This took the entertainment industry by storm and continues to be a well loved song.&#10;Being the very accomplished roots singer he was it wasno mistake when the Heptones recruited him to replace Leroy Sibbles after he migrated in 1975. His deep roots style perfectly complimented the Heptones (Earl Morgan, Barry Llewellyn) keen harmony As lead singer for the Heptones they were the first to grace the stages of  the first Reggae Sun Splash that came to Jarrett Park Montego bay. It was a real honor for him to be apart of such a momentous  event in the history of Jamaican reggae music. They opened the show billed with top artist such as Bob Marley, Ken Booth Alton Ellis and many others. It was the first performance but not the last. They also performed  in the 1982 at the Catherine Hall Bob Marley Center. &#10;The Heptones recorded a song for Channel one called, “How Could I Leave,” and others but Paulie(owner of channel) died and those songs weren’t released but played on dub plate.  Dennis Brown re-recorded the same song How Could I Leave on the Joe Gibbs label and it became number one.  Despite this the Heptones kept going. They  did an album  called , “Better Days” for Winston Niney Holliness  Boswell  then they went to England on tour in 1975. The Heptones toured Europe, Canada and the USA. One of Naggo’s  most treasured memory is visiting Scotland and seeing men wearing skirts with their bag pipes a big cultural difference.    &#10;He has worked with musicians such as Ansell Collins (key boards), Lloyd Park(Bass), Robbie Shaekespear(Bass), Sly Dunbar(drums), Frankie Bubbler (Organ), Ranchie McLean (guitarist), Ricka Backa (guitarist), Bongo Herman (percussion), Frank Aird aka Blazing Frank (trumpet), Vin Gordon (trombone), Deadly Headley( alto horns), &#10;My new album Everyday Life a Morris Must production will be out soon. Songs written by him, but four in combination with Vivia Morris, backing vocals Earl Morgan, Barringtong Llewellyn and Naggo lead vocalist. The album was arranged by The Heptones, Vivia Morris, Errol Morris and Mitchell Morris.&#10;He gives thanks to  Winston Holliness and Larry MacDonald  for producing most of his music.  Thanks to Earl Morgan and Barry Llewellyn for the opportunity to work with them . A special thank you to Roy Francis from the mixing lab studios.&#10;Naggo Morris continues to perform with the Heptones and to do solo acts. He is now making preparations for shows in Canada, USA, Europe and Brazil.&#10;&#10;For Booking and Reservations:&#10;Contact: Vivia Morris&#10; Manager:&#10;Telephone: 1-763-568-6067.&#10;E-Mail: viviamanda@hotmail.com&#10;Skype: vivia.morris&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Naggo+Morris&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>With the tragic murder of Hugh Mundell, who was shot and killed while sitting in a car with Junior Reid, reggae lost one of its most promising young performers. Mundell&apos;s 1978 debut album, Africa Must Be Free By 1983, produced by Augustus Pablo, in Jamaica remains a classic roots reggae recording. Mundell&apos;s singing style and soothing voice will lull you into tranquility if you let it. &#10;&#10;Mundell, the son of a prominent Jamaican lawyer, was still a teenager when he teamed with influential producer Joe Gibbs to record a still-unreleased single, &quot;&apos;Where Is Natty Dread.&quot; His first break came when he was hired as a DJ for Augustus Pablo&apos;s Rockers sound system. His debut single, &quot;Africa Must Be Free by 1983&quot;, produced by Augustus Pablo, was released in early 1978. Mundell also recorded several 12&quot; singles as Jah Levi. &#10;&#10;Mundell continued recording with Pablo. The albums Time &amp; Place and Blackman&apos;s Foundation followed shortly after, and then a few tracks for Prince Jammy were gathered together along with some of Lacksley Castell&apos;s, put on an album and called Jah Fire. &#10;&#10;Beginning in 1979, Mundell took over the production of his own recordings. He released his Mundell album on Greensleeves in 1982. He also produced the debut album, Speak the Truth, by &quot;Little&quot; Junior Reid, on Pablo&apos;s label, Rockers. &#10;&#10;In 1983 he became involved in an argument and was shot in the neck. Shortly afterwards, his posthumous album Arise was released. A dub version of Africa Must Be Free By 1983 was released in 1989 and then packaged with the original by Greensleeves and RAS, and then Makasound packaged Time &amp; Place and Blackman&apos;s Foundation together and released it as The Blessed Youth in 2003. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Hugh+Mundell&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Jamaican ska vocal group The Maytals became a reggae band 1971, renamed Toots and The Maytals with Frederick &quot;Toots&quot; Hibbert as front figure. The band got a Grammy award 2005 for the album True Love. Funky Kingston in early 70s is on Rolling Stone&apos;s list The Greatest Albums of All Time. Bass line in &apos;54-46 That&apos;s My Number&apos; is one of the most covered in pop music. &apos;Monkey Man&apos;, &apos;Pressure Drop&apos;, &apos;Bam Bam&apos;, etc, made them to favorites for the early skinhead movement of white working-class youth in UK.  &#10;- - -&#10;&#10;Toots and The Maytals  are from Kingston, Jamaica. It was the producer Byron Lee who 1971 renamed them Toots &amp; the Maytals. Frederick &quot;Toots&quot; Hibbert, the leader of the group and the lead singer, was born in May Pen in the Parish of Clarendon, Jamaica. He was the youngest of seven children. He grew up singing gospel music in a church choir, but moved to Kingston in 1961 at the age of sixteen.&#10;&#10;In Kingston, he met Henry &quot;Raleigh&quot; Gordon and Nathaniel &quot;Jerry&quot; McCarthy, forming a group whose early recordings were attributed to &quot;The Flames&quot; and, possibly, &quot;The Vikings&quot;. Having renamed the group the Maytals, the vocal trio recorded their first album, &quot;Never Grow Old - presenting the Maytals&quot;, for producer Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd at Studio One in 1962-63. With musical backing from Dodd&apos;s house band, the legendary Skatalites, the Maytals&apos; close-harmony gospel singing ensured instant success for the 1964 release, overshadowing Dodd&apos;s other up-and-coming gospel trio, The Wailers. The original album augmented by studio out-takes from the Studio One sessions was re-released by Heartbeat/Rounder Records in 1997, and is essential listening for Maytals and Skatalites fans.&#10;&#10;After staying at Studio One for about two years, the group moved on to do sessions for Prince Buster (released in 1974) before recording their second album produced by Byron Lee in 1965. However, the band&apos;s musical career was rudely interrupted in late 1966 when Hibbert was arrested and imprisoned on drug possession charges.&#10;&#10;Following Hibbert&apos;s release from jail towards the end of 1967, the band officially changed their name to Toots and the Maytals and began working with Chinese-Jamaican producer Leslie Kong, a collaboration which produced three classic albums and a string of hits throughout the late sixties and early seventies - &quot;Do the Reggay&quot;, a 1968 single widely credited with coining the word reggae, &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, &quot;54-46 was my number&quot; and &quot;Monkey Man&quot;, the group&apos;s first international hit in 1970. The group was featured in one of reggae&apos;s greatest breakthrough events - The Harder They Come, the 1972 film and soundtrack starring Jimmy Cliff.&#10;&#10;Following Kong&apos;s death in 1971, the group continued to record with Kong&apos;s former sound engineer, Warwick Lyn; produced by Lyn and Chris Blackwell of Island Records, the group released three best-selling albums, and enjoyed international hits with &quot;Funky Kingston&quot; in 1973 and &quot;Reggae Got Soul&quot; in 1976.&#10;&#10;Toots and the Maytals&apos; compositions would be given a second airing in 1978-80 during the reggae-punk and ska revival period in the UK, when the Specials included &quot;Monkey Man&quot; on their 1979 debut album and the Clash produced their version of &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, with other Maytals&apos; covers being recorded by Sublime. Having toured throughout the world for many years, Toots and the Maytals disbanded in the early 1980s, but reformed in the early 90s to continue touring and recording successfully.&#10;&#10;The band recently won the 2005 Grammy award for reggae for the album True Love, an album consisting of re-recorded versions of their classics alongside popular and legendary musicians such as Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, and Keith Richards, as well as popular artists today such as No Doubt, Ben Harper, The Roots, and Shaggy.&#10;&#10;They also contributed to the Easy Star All-Stars album &apos;Radiodread&apos; (a dub tribute to Radiohead&apos;s OK Computer). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Toots+and+The+Maytals&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Michelle Lynn Johnson officially changed her professional name from Me&apos;Shell NdegéOcello to simply Meshell Ndegeocello, with the release of her 2001 album, &quot;Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape&quot;.&#10;&#10;Meshell Ndegeocello (b. August 29, 1968) is a singer, bassist, and multi-instrumentalist. She was born Michelle Johnson to Army lieutenant (and saxophonist) father Jacques Johnson and her mother, Helen in Berlin, Germany.&#10;&#10;Raised in Washington, D.C., Meshell Suihailia Bashir Shakur (as she became known) adopted the surname Ndegeocello, which means &quot;free like a bird&quot;, while still in her teens. She has been hailed in the music press as a redeemer of soul music. Her music incorporates funk, soul, hip-hop, reggae, rock and jazz. She has been nominated for 9 Grammys. She has frequently toured with Lilith Fair.&#10;&#10;Ndegeocello honed her chops on the D.C. Go go circuit in the late 1980s before venturing out as a solo artist. She emerged as a recording artist in 1993 on Maverick Records/Sire Records with her debut, Plantation Lullabies. This recording presented a distinctly androgynous persona. Her music has been featured in a number of film soundtracks including How Stella Got Her Groove Back and Batman and Robin. She has also appeared on recordings by Basement Jaxx and The Blind Boys of Alabama, among others. Her biggest hit is a duet with John Cougar Mellencamp, a cover version of Van Morrison&apos;s &quot;Wild Night&quot;, which reached #3 on the Billboard charts.&#10;&#10;Her singles &quot;If That&apos;s Your Boyfriend (He Wasn&apos;t Last Night)&quot;, &quot;Leviticus: Faggot&quot;, and her cover of Bill Withers &quot;Who Is He and What Is He To You?&quot; have all charted in the Billboard top 20. She sang background vocals on the song &quot;I&apos;d Rather be Your Lover&quot; by Madonna, on her album &quot;Bedtime Stories.&quot;. She also sang with Chaka Khan on the single &quot;Never Miss the Water&quot;, as well as providing her typical solid bass skills.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Meshell+Ndegeocello&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Steven Paul &quot;Elliott&quot; Smith (August 6, 1969 – October 21, 2003) was an American songwriter and musician. Smith was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and resided for a significant portion of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he first gained popularity. His primary instrument was the guitar, but he was also proficient at piano, clarinet, bass, drums and harmonica. Smith had a distinctive vocal style characterized by his &quot;whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery&quot; and use of multi-tracking to create vocal harmonies.&#10;&#10;After playing in the rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994 with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars. In 1997 he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, included in the soundtrack for the film Good Will Hunting, was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category in 1997.&#10;&#10;Smith battled with depression, alcoholism and drug addiction for years, and these topics often appeared in his lyrics. At age 34, he died in Los Angeles, California from two stab wounds to the chest. The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, From a Basement on the Hill, which was released posthumously on October 19, 2004.&#10;&#10;Early life&#10;&#10;Steven Paul Smith was born at Clarkson Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska. His mother, Bunny Welch (née Bunny Kay Berryman), was a music teacher at an elementary school, and his father, Gary Smith, was a University of Nebraska medical student at the time. His parents divorced about a year later, and Smith moved with his mother to live in Duncanville, Texas. Much later in his life, Smith got a tattoo of a map of Texas on his upper arm and said, &quot;I didn&apos;t get it because I like Texas, kinda the opposite. But I won&apos;t forget about it although I&apos;m tempted to &apos;cause I don&apos;t like it there.&quot; Smith endured a difficult childhood and a troubled relationship with his stepfather Charlie. Smith reflected the impact of this part of his life in the lyrics of &quot;Some Song&quot;: &quot;Charlie beat you up week after week, and when you grow up you&apos;re going to be a freak.&quot; The name &quot;Charlie&quot; also appeared in the lyrics for &quot;Flowers for Charlie&quot; and &quot;No Confidence Man&quot;. The family was a part of the Community of Christ through much of Smith&apos;s childhood, but eventually began attending services at a local Methodist Church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him &quot;really scared of hell&quot;. In a 2001 interview, he stated, &quot;I don&apos;t necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But I have my own version of it&quot;. At the age of nine, Smith began playing the piano, and at ten began learning guitar on a small acoustic guitar bought for him by his father. At this age he also composed an original piano piece, &quot;Fantasy,&quot; which won him a prize at an arts festival. Many of the people on his mother&apos;s side of the family were non-professional musicians; his grandfather was a Dixieland drummer and his grandmother sang in a glee club.&#10;&#10;At 14, Smith moved from Texas to Portland, Oregon, to live with his father, who was then working as a psychiatrist. It was around this time that Smith first began trying drugs and alcohol with friends as well as experimenting with recording for the first time, borrowing a four-track recorder. During high school, Smith played clarinet in the school band and also played guitar, piano and sang in the bands Stranger Than Fiction, A Murder of Crows and The Greenhouse, billed as either Steven Smith or &quot;Johnny Panic&quot;. He graduated from Lincoln High School as a National Merit Scholar.&#10;&#10;After graduation, Steven Smith began calling himself &quot;Elliott&quot;, saying that he thought &quot;Steve&quot; sounded too much like a &quot;jock&quot; name, and that &quot;Steven&quot; sounded &quot;too bookish&quot;. Biographer S. R. Shutt speculates that it was either inspired by Elliott Avenue, a street that Smith had lived on in Portland, or that it was suggested by his then-girlfriend. A junior high acquaintance of Smith speculates that it was so as not to be confused with Steve Smith, the drummer of Journey.&#10;&#10;Heatmiser&#10;&#10;Smith graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1991 with a degree in philosophy and political science. &quot;Went straight through in four years,&quot; he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. &quot;I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn&apos;t want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, &apos;This is your one and only chance to go to college and you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.&apos; Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day.&quot; After he graduated he &quot;worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and legal theory.&quot; While at Hampshire, Smith formed the band Heatmiser with classmate Neil Gust. After graduating from Hampshire, the band added drummer Tony Lash and bassist Brandt Peterson and began performing around Portland in 1992. The group released the albums Dead Air (1993) and Cop and Speeder (1994) as well as the Yellow No. 5 EP (1994) on Frontier Records, and were then signed to Virgin Records to release what became their final album Mic City Sons (1996).&#10;&#10;Smith had begun his solo career while still in Heatmiser, and the success of his first two releases created distance and tension with his band. Heatmiser disbanded prior to Mic City Sons&apos; release, prompting Virgin to put the album out inauspiciously through its independent arm, Caroline Records. A clause in Heatmiser&apos;s record contract with Virgin meant that Smith was still bound to it as an individual. The contract was later bought-out by DreamWorks prior to the release of his album, XO.&#10;&#10;Roman Candle&#10;&#10;His first release, Roman Candle (1994), came about when Smith&apos;s girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of &quot;the most recent eight songs that [he’d] recorded on borrowed four-tracks and borrowed guitar&quot; to Cavity Search Records. Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was only expecting a deal for a seven-inch record. Regarding the record, Smith said &quot;I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular. [...] The thing is that album was really well-received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed Heatmiser unfortunately.&quot; Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: &quot;The idea of playing [my music] for people didn&apos;t occur to me... because at the time it was the Northwest – Mudhoney and Nirvana – and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off.&quot; The instrumentation of the recordings was primarily acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by brief electric guitar riffs or a small drum set played with brushes. Only the final track, an instrumental titled &quot;Kiwi Maddog 20/20&quot; (a reference to the bum wine MD 20/20), had full band instrumentation.&#10;&#10;Smith&apos;s debut solo performance was at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from Roman Candle were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set comprised of B-sides, Heatmiser tunes, and unreleased tracks. Soon after this performance, he was asked to open for Mary Lou Lord on a week-long U.S. tour. Several more short tours followed, and Smith helped her record one of his songs &quot;I Figured You Out&quot;, which he once called &quot;a stupid pop song [written] in about a minute&quot; that he discarded for &quot;[sounding] like the fucking Eagles.&quot;&#10;Elliott Smith and Either/Or&#10;&#10;In 1995, the self-titled album Elliott Smith was released on Kill Rock Stars; the record featured a similar style of recording to Roman Candle, but not without hints of growth and experimentation. Though the majority of the album was recorded by Smith alone, friend and Spinanes vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on &quot;St. Ides Heaven&quot;, and Heatmiser guitarist Neil Gust played guitar on &quot;Single File&quot;. Several songs made reference to drugs, but Smith explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being about drugs specifically. Looking back, Smith felt that the album&apos;s pervasive mood gave him &quot;a reputation for being a really dark, depressed person,&quot; and said that he later made a conscious move toward more diverse moods in his music.&#10;&#10;In 1996, filmmaker Jem Cohen recorded Smith playing acoustic songs for the short film Lucky Three: an Elliott Smith Portrait. Two of these songs would appear on his next album, Either/Or, another Kill Rock Stars release that came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing bass, drums, keyboards and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title was derived from the two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, which deals with such themes as existential despair, dread, death and God.&#10;&#10;By this time, Smith&apos;s already-heavy drinking was now being compounded with use of anti-depressants. At the end of the Either/Or tour, an intervention was staged by close friends of his in Chicago, but it proved ineffective.&#10;&#10;Miss Misery and the Oscars&#10;&#10;In 1996, Smith was tapped by director and fellow Portland resident Gus Van Sant to be a part of the soundtrack to his film, Good Will Hunting. Smith recorded an orchestral version of &quot;Between the Bars (Orchestral)&quot; with acclaimed composer Danny Elfman for the movie. Smith also contributed a new song, &quot;Miss Misery,&quot; and three other previously released tracks (&quot;No Name #3&quot;, from Roman Candle, and &quot;Angeles&quot; and &quot;Say Yes&quot;, from Either/Or). The film was a commercial and critical success, and Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for &quot;Miss Misery&quot;. Not eager to step into the limelight, he only agreed to perform the song at the ceremony after the producers informed him that his song would be played live that night — either by him or another musician of their choosing.&#10;&#10;On March 5, 1998, Smith made his network television debut on Late Night With Conan O&apos;Brien performing &quot;Miss Misery&quot; solo on acoustic guitar. A few days later, wearing a white suit, he played an abridged version of the song at the Oscars, accompanied by the house orchestra. James Horner and Will Jennings won the award that night for best song with &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; (sung by Celine Dion) from the film Titanic. Smith did not voice disappointment about not winning the award.&#10;&#10;Smith commented on the surrealism of the Oscars experience: &quot;That&apos;s exactly what it was, surreal... I enjoy performing almost as much as I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was a lot of people who didn&apos;t come to hear me play. I wouldn&apos;t want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day.&quot;&#10;XO and Figure 8&#10;&#10;In 1998, after the success of Either/Or and &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, Smith signed to a bigger independent record label, DreamWorks Records. Around the same time, Smith fell into depression, speaking openly of considering suicide, and on at least one occasion made a serious attempt at ending his own life. While in North Carolina, he became severely intoxicated and ran off a cliff. He landed on a tree, which badly impaled him but broke his fall. When questioned about his suicide attempt, he told an interviewer, &quot;Um, yeah – I jumped off a cliff. But it didn&apos;t work.&quot; Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which released Roman Candle), said about this time in Smith&apos;s life: &quot;I talked him out of thinking that he wanted to kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him.&quot; Smith&apos;s first release for DreamWorks was later that year. Titled XO, it was produced by the team of Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock. XO also contained some instrumentation from Los Angeles musicians Joey Waronker and Jon Brion. It contained a more full-sounding, baroque pop sound than any of his previous efforts, with songs featuring a horn section, Chamberlins and elaborate string arrangements and even a drum loop on the song &quot;Independence Day&quot;. His familiar double-tracked vocal and acoustic guitar style was still apparent. The album went on to peak at number 104 on the Billboard 200 and sold 400,000 copies (more than double that of each of his two Kill Rock Stars releases), becoming the best-selling release of his career. Smith&apos;s backing band during most of this period was the Portland-based group Quasi, consisting of former bandmate Sam Coomes on bass guitar and Coomes&apos;s ex-wife Janet Weiss on drums. Quasi also performed as the opening act at many shows on the tour, with Smith sometimes contributing bass, guitar or backing vocals. On October 17, 1998, Smith appeared on Saturday Night Live and performed &quot;Waltz #2.&quot; His backing band for this appearance was John Moen, Jon Brion, Rob Schnapf and Sam Coomes.&#10;&#10;In response to whether the change to a bigger record label would influence his creative control, Smith said: &quot;...sometimes people look at major labels as simply money-making machines, they&apos;re actually composed of individuals who are real people, and there&apos;s a part of them that needs to feel that part of their job is to put out good music.&quot; Smith also claimed in another interview that he never read his reviews for fear that they would interfere with his songwriting.&#10;&#10;Figure 8, which was released in 2000, featured the return of Rothrock, Schnapf, Brion, and Waronker, and was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in England. The album garnered generally positive reviews and peaked at number 99 on the Billboard 200. The album garnered praise for its power pop style and complex arrangements, described as creating a &quot;sweeping kaleidoscope of layered instruments and sonic textures.&quot; However, some reviewers felt that Smith&apos;s trademark dark and melancholy songwriting had lost some of its subtlety, with one reviewer likening some of the songs to &quot;the self-pitying complaints of an adolescent venting in his diary.&quot;&#10;&#10;Album art and promotional pictures showed Smith looking cleaned-up and put-together. An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, including television appearances on Late Night With Conan O&apos;Brien and The Late Show With David Letterman. However, Smith&apos;s condition began to deteriorate as he had become addicted to heroin either towards the end of or just after the Figure 8 tour.&#10;&#10;Final years and recording of From a Basement on the Hill&#10;&#10;A follow-up to Smith&apos;s 2000 album was originally planned to happen with Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded a substantial amount of music for the album, when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work up until that point. He later said: &quot;There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn&apos;t want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs.&quot; When Brion sent a bill for the abandoned sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer voiced what he believed to be intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith sent a message to the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell, a member of the band Goldenboy. McConnell told SPIN that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd (of The Flaming Lips) and Scott McPherson played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.&#10;&#10;One of the few highlights for Smith in 2001 was inclusion of his song &quot;Needle in the Hay&quot; in Wes Anderson&apos;s dark comedy The Royal Tenenbaums. The song plays during a suicide attempt. Smith was originally supposed to contribute a cover of The Beatles&apos; &quot;Hey Jude&quot; for the film, but when he failed to do so in time, Anderson had to use The Mutato Muzika Orchestra&apos;s version of the track instead. Anderson would later say that Smith &quot;was in a bad state&quot; at the time.&#10;&#10;Smith&apos;s live performances during 2001 and 2002 were infrequent, typically in the Pacific Northwest or Los Angeles. A review of his December 20, 2001 show at Portland&apos;s Crystal Ballroom stated concern over his appearance and performance: his hair was uncharacteristically greasy and long; his face was bearded and gaunt; and during his songs he exhibited alarming signs of &quot;memory-loss and butterfingers&quot;. The crowd would often have to shout out the lyrics (and in some cases, guitar chords) when Smith could not think of them.&#10;&#10;In the first of only three concerts performed in 2002, Smith co-headlined Northwestern University&apos;s &quot;A&amp;O Ball&quot; with Wilco on May 2 in Chicago. Smith&apos;s performance was described as &quot;undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician&quot; and an &quot;excruciating... nightmare&quot;. A reporter for the online magazine Glorious Noise made the statement &quot;...it would not surprise me at all if Elliott Smith ends up dead within a year.&quot;&#10;&#10;On November 25, 2002, Smith was involved in a brawl with the Los Angeles Police Department at a Flaming Lips/Beck concert. Smith later said he was defending a man he thought the police were harassing. Assuming that Smith was homeless, the officers allegedly beat and arrested him and his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba. The two spent the night in jail. Smith&apos;s hand and back were injured in the incident, causing him to cancel a number of shows. Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips and a friend of Smith&apos;s, stated concern over Smith&apos;s appearance and actions, saying that he &quot;saw a guy who had lost control of himself. He was needy, he was grumpy, he was everything you wouldn&apos;t want in a person. It&apos;s not like when you think of Keith Richards being pleasantly blissed out in the corner.&quot; Smith had attempted to go to rehab several times, but said he &quot;couldn&apos;t honestly do the first step... I couldn&apos;t say what you were supposed to say and mean it.&quot; In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center: &quot;What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you&apos;re on a drip bag, but the only thing that&apos;s in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I&apos;m not psychotic.&quot; After his 34th birthday on August 6, 2003, he gave up alcohol, caffeine, red meat, refined sugar and his longtime (sometimes abused) regimen of psychiatric medication. Director Mike Mills had been working with Smith during his final years and described Smith&apos;s troubles and apparent recovery: &quot;I gave the script to him, then he dropped off the face of the earth… He went through his whole crazy time, but by the time I was done with the film, he was making From a Basement on a Hill and I was shocked that he was actually making music.&quot; With things improving for Smith after several troubled years, he began experimenting with noise music and worked on his girlfriend Jennifer Chiba&apos;s iMac with the intent of learning how to record with computers, noting that it was the only method with which he was still unfamiliar. Smith jokingly labeled his experimental way of recording &quot;The California Frown&quot; (a play on the Beach Boys&apos; &quot;California Sound&quot;). He said of the songs: &quot;They&apos;re kind of more noisy with the pitch all distorted. Some are more acoustic, but there aren&apos;t too many like that. Lately I&apos;ve just been making up a lot of noise.&quot; He was also in the process of recording songs for the Thumbsucker soundtrack, including Big Star&apos;s &quot;Thirteen&quot;, and Cat Stevens&apos; &quot;Trouble&quot;. In August 2003, Suicide Squeeze Records put out a limited-edition vinyl single for &quot;Pretty (Ugly Before)&quot;, a song that Smith had been playing since the Figure 8 tour. Steve Hanft described the last six months of Smith&apos;s life as being &quot;like the light at the end of the tunnel&quot; and was convinced that Smith was clean and recovered.&#10;&#10;Death and reactions&#10;&#10;Elliott Smith died on October 21, 2003, at age 34 from two stab wounds to the chest. According to girlfriend Jennifer Chiba, with whom he was living at the time, the two were arguing, and she locked herself in the bathroom. Chiba heard him scream, and upon opening the door, saw Smith standing with a kitchen knife in his chest. She pulled the knife out, after which he collapsed and she called 911. Smith died in the hospital with the time of death listed as 1:36 p.m. While Smith&apos;s death was originally reported as a suicide, the official autopsy report released in December 2003 left open the question of possible homicide. A possible suicide note, written on a Post-it, read, &quot;I&apos;m so sorry—love, Elliott. God forgive me.&quot; According to Pitchfork, producer Larry Crane reported on his Tape Op message board that he had planned to help Smith mix his album in mid-November. Crane wrote: &quot;I hadn&apos;t talked to Elliott in over a year. His girlfriend, Jennifer, called me [last week] and asked if I&apos;d like to come to L.A. and help mix and finish [Smith&apos;s album]. I said yes, of course, and chatted with Elliott for the first time in ages. It seems surreal that he would call me to finish an album and then a week later kill himself. I talked to Jennifer this morning, who was obviously shattered and in tears, and she said, &apos;I don&apos;t understand, he was so healthy.&quot; The coroner&apos;s report revealed that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol were found in his system at the time of his death. The coroner did find anti-depressant and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder medications in his system, but at prescribed levels. With his death not being officially declared a suicide, a journalist noted that some have suspected foul play, but also that the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.&#10;&#10;Soon after his death, a fan memorial was initiated outside of Solutions Audio (4334 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California), the site at which the cover of the Figure 8 album was shot. Farewell messages to Smith were written on the wall, flowers were brought and photos, candles and empty bottles of alcohol mentioned in Smith&apos;s songs were left. The owner of Solutions has, as of April 2008, allowed the memorial to stand. Memorial concerts were held in several cities in America and England. A petition was soon put forth with intent to make part of the Silver Lake area a memorial park in Smith&apos;s honor. It received over 10,000 signatures, but no plans to go forth with the park have been announced. Another memorial is located inside Smith&apos;s former high school, Lincoln High, and was erected in July 2006.&#10;&#10;Since Smith&apos;s death, many musical acts have paid him tribute. Songs in tribute to, or about Smith have been released by Rilo Kiley (&quot;Ripchord&quot; and &quot;It Just Is&quot; on More Adventurous), Sparta (&quot;Bombs and Us&quot;), Ben Folds (&quot;Late&quot; on Songs for Silverman), Third Eye Blind (&quot;Elliott Smith&quot; on Symphony of Decay), Mary Lorson (&quot;Lonely Boy&quot; on Realistic), Rhett Miller (&quot;The Believer&quot; on The Believer), Earlimart (&quot;Heaven Adores You&quot; on Treble and Tremble), Pete Yorn (&quot;Bandstand in the Sky&quot; on Nightcrawler, a song jointly dedicated to Jeff Buckley), and Ginger Sling (&quot;Faith&quot; on the &quot;Room&quot; EP). Several tribute albums have been released since his death: To: Elliott From: Portland, Home to Oblivion: Elliott Smith Tribute, Remote Memory: A Tribute to Elliott Smith, A Tribute to Elliott Smith and The String Quartet Tribute to Elliott Smith.&#10;&#10;Posthumous releases&#10;&#10;From a Basement on the Hill, with almost four years in production, was released October 19, 2004 by ANTI- Records (a part of Epitaph Records). With Smith&apos;s family in control of his estate, they chose to bring in Rob Schnapf and Smith&apos;s ex-girlfriend Joanna Bolme to sort through and mix the album. Although predicted by Smith to be a double album (or a regular album with a &quot;bonus disc&quot;), it was released as a 15-track single album. Many of the darkest songs from the sessions (later leaked onto the Internet) were not included, such as &quot;True Love&quot; (which deals graphically with addiction and rehab), &quot;Abused&quot;, &quot;Stickman&quot; and &quot;Suicide Machine&quot; (a reworking of the Figure 8 era unreleased instrumental, &quot;Tiny Time Machine&quot;). It is rumored that it was the family&apos;s wishes not to have these songs on the record, as they had the final say in what should and should not be released. Reviews of the album were mostly very positive, but some were more critical; The Onion&apos;s A.V. Club wrote that &quot;the album he left behind turns out to be messy, complicated, and unquestionably not his defining work...the album still earns its place—not at the top, and unfortunately as a bookend—in a jarringly important body of work.&quot; Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing, a biography by Benjamin Nugent, was rushed to publication and hit stores shortly after From a Basement on the Hill, barely beyond the first anniversary of the musician&apos;s death. Smith&apos;s family, as well as Joanna Bolme, Jennifer Chiba, Neil Gust, Sam Coomes, and Janet Weiss, all declined to be interviewed and did not support the publication of the book. It contained interviews with Rob Schnapf, David McConnell, and Pete Krebs. The book received mixed reviews, with Publishers Weekly remarking that while &quot;Nugent manages to patch together the major beats of Smith&apos;s life, he can offer little meaningful insight&quot; and that Smith&apos;s fans &quot;will be disappointed by this short and shallow biography.&quot;&#10;&#10;On May 8, 2007, a posthumous two-disc compilation album entitled New Moon was released by Kill Rock Stars. The album contained 24 songs recorded by Smith between 1994 and 1997 during his tenure with the label. The songs consisted of demos, early versions, previously released b-sides and some unfinished tracks. In the U.S., the album debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week. The record received favorable reviews and was Metacritic&apos;s 16th best-reviewed album of 2007. A significant portion of the proceeds from album sales are to go to Outside In, a social service agency for low-income adults and homeless youth in Portland, Oregon.&#10;&#10;On October 25, 2007, a book titled Elliott Smith was released by Autumn de Wilde, which consists of photographs, handwritten lyrics and &quot;revealing talks with Smith&apos;s inner circle&quot;. De Wilde was responsible for the Figure 8 sleeve art, making a landmark and de facto Smith memorial of the Solutions Audio mural. A five-song CD featuring previously unreleased live recordings of Smith performing acoustically at Club Largo in Los Angeles was included in the release.&#10;&#10;Musical style and influences&#10;&#10;Smith respected and was inspired by many artists and styles, including U2, The Kinks, Elvis Costello, Motown and flamenco records, AC/DC, Scorpions, and Modest Mouse. Smith claimed to listen exclusively to select albums (such as The Marble Index by Nico) for months. Sean Croghan (a former roommate of Smith&apos;s and member of bands Jr. High and Crackerbash) said that Smith &quot;listened almost exclusively to slow jams&quot; in his senior year at college. Smith was also known to gain inspiration from novels, religion and philosophy. He liked classic literature, especially Samuel Beckett, T. S. Eliot, and Fyodor Dostoevsky (and other Russian novelists).&#10;&#10;Smith mentioned his admiration for Bob Dylan in several interviews, citing him as an early musical influence. He once commented: &quot;My father taught me how to play &quot;Don&apos;t Think Twice, It&apos;s All Right&quot;. I love Dylan&apos;s words, but even more than that, I love the fact that he loves words.&quot; Smith covered Dylan&apos;s &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot; several times in concert.&#10;&#10;Smith was a dedicated fan of The Beatles (as well as their solo projects), once noting that he had been listening to them frequently since he was about &quot;four years old&quot; and also claimed that hearing The White Album was his original inspiration to become a musician. In 1998, Smith recorded and contributed a cover of the Beatles song &quot;Because&quot; to the American Beauty soundtrack, which can be heard during the closing credits of the film. Although this was the only Beatles song that Smith ever officially released, he is known to have recorded at least one other (&quot;Revolution (Beatles Cover)&quot;, during the sessions for XO), and played many songs by both the band and the members&apos; solo projects at live concerts. &#10;&#10;Regarding his songwriting, Smith said: “The way I think about it is... I don&apos;t really think about it in terms of language, I think about it more like shapes. That&apos;s an interesting thing to talk about but it&apos;s difficult. I&apos;m really into chord changes. That was the thing that I liked when I was a kid. So, I&apos;m not like a... I don&apos;t make up &apos;a riff&apos; really. It&apos;s usually like... that sequence that has some implied melody in it or something like that.” Smith said that transitions were his favorite part of songs and that he preferred to write broader, more impressionistic music closer to pop rather than folk music. Smith compared his songs to stories or dreams, not purely confessional pieces that people could relate to. When asked about the dark nature of his songwriting and the cult following he was gaining, Smith said he felt it was merely a product of him writing songs that were strongly meaningful to him rather than anything contrived. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Elliott+Smith&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content> Malcolm John &quot;Mac&quot; Rebennack, Jr. (born November 21, 1940), better known by the stage name Dr. John (also Dr. John Creaux), is an American singer-songwriter, pianist and guitarist whose music combines blues, boogie woogie and rock and roll.  The winner of five Grammy awards, Rebennack was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by singer John Legend on Monday, March 14, 2011.&#10;&#10;Dr. John has been making his own idiosyncratic music since the 1960s. Along with Professor Longhair, Dr. John is heir to the rich New Orleans tradition. He is perhaps best known for &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot;, an international hit in 1973, reissued and used on soundtracks many times since.&#10;&#10;Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, his professional musical career began as a session musician in New Orleans in the 1950s. Early on he also played guitar and was often known as Mac Rebennack. He switched to the bass (&quot;the lowest time of my life&quot;), and then the piano after his index finger was nearly shot off protecting his bandmate and longtime friend Ronnie Barron. He gained fame beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with music that combined New Orleans-style rhythm and blues with psychedelic rock and stage shows that bordered on voodoo religious ceremonies, including elaborate costumes and headdress. For a time he was billed as Doctor John, The Night Tripper. The name &quot;Dr. John&quot; came from a legendary Louisiana voodoo practitioner from the start of the 19th century.&#10;&#10;Dr. John has also done vocals for Popeyes Chicken &amp; Biscuits&apos; &quot;Luv dat chicken...&quot; jingle, as well as the theme song (&quot;My Opinionation&quot;) for the early-1990s television sitcom Blossom. His movie credits include Martin Scorsese&apos;s documentary The Last Waltz (in which he joins The Band for a performance of his song &quot;Such a Night&quot;) and Blues Brothers 2000 (in which he joins the fictional band The Louisiana Gator Boys to perform the song &quot;New Orleans&quot;).  In the 2009 Disney film The Princess and the Frog, Dr. John sings the opening tune, &quot;Down in New Orleans&quot;.&#10;&#10;In January 2008 Mac Rebennack, Dr. John, was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame.&#10;&#10;&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+John&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

Their first few releases appeared on the Catalogue imprint and were lapped up by those seeking a way to wind down after a night of furious funking to the likes of Pepe Bradock and Daft Punk. &quot;Mundo&quot; has been licensed from Catalogue for the Wagram Music double CD, Paris Lounge. It sits comfortably (on a chaise longue) next to cuts from Llorca, Le Tone, Kojak, and Next Evidence. Tim &apos;Love&apos; Lee fans will be impressed by the way Sporto Kantes combine Latin and Afro-Cuban influences with modern breakbeat technology. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sporto+Kantes&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

She sings in both French and English.&#10;&#10;Besides the highly successful &quot;Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son&quot;, she&apos;s also notably sung &quot;Les Sucettes&quot; and &quot;Baby Pop&quot;.  In France, she is perhaps more known for the chanson songs she sang in the late-70s through the mid-80s, many of them which written by her husband, Michel Berger, who is now deceased. In 1987, she had some additional international success with her Ella Fitzgerald tribute &quot;Ella, elle l&apos;a&quot;.

<content>There are 3 bands with the name Simon Says.  One is a hard rock band from California, and the other is a prog rock band from Sweden. Simon Says is also a band from Estonia, Narva. They&apos;re a metalcore band with nu metal influences.&#10;&#10;Simon Says (U.S.):&#10;Simon Says was formed by a group of California high schoolers (Matt Franks, Zac Diebels, and Mike Johnston) who got their start playing high school auditoriums around the state in the early 1990s. Adding bassist Mike Arrieta in 1995, the group self-released two records, which attracted the attention of manager Jeff Saltzman. Saltzman set them up with Cake&apos;s producer Mark Needham and got them signed to Hollywood Records in July 1998. In 1999, they released their major-label debut, Jump Start, which yielded two hit modern rock singles, and the follow-up Shut Your Breath added a third radio hit.&#10;&#10;In 2001, Simon Says left Hollywood Records over promotional issues and changed their name to Key to Arson; soon after, drummer Mike Johnston left the band, to be replaced by Dave &quot;Stixx&quot; Marich. In 2004, Key to Arson announced the completion of an album entitled Light &apos;Em Up, but by the end of the year the band had broken up.&#10;&#10;Simon Says (Sweden):&#10;Stockholm in the early 90&apos;s was throbbing with prog. Numerous bands played small clubs and pubs in Sweden&apos;s capital. Most attention was paid to Anekdoten, Änglagaard and Landberk. &#10;&#10;On the fringes of this underground movement there was a less known band called Egg. An unorthodox band: while sounding as harsh and brutal as both VdGG and Crimson, they still struggled to make their melodies as catchy as those of pop tune. &#10;&#10;Bass player of Egg at the time was Stefan Renström, who upon joining them immediately had sensed the band&apos;s potential. But when Stefan wanted to lead the band in a certain direction, a lot of friction surfaced. Furthermore, his personal life collapsed and Stefan, unhappily, left both the band and Stockholm to form a new outfit. &#10;&#10;Around Christmas &apos;93 he made contact with a then very young Daniel Fäldt, singer of experimental band Leifs Hyvel. Things were settled: Simon Says was to be a project with the two of them as the nucleus. &#10;&#10;In March &apos;94 Stefan and producer Kenneth Magnusson started planning Simon Says&apos; first album. In August 1995 Ceinwen was released, to mostly positive reviews. A live act was put together and Simon Says looked like they were growing into a band. After a few gigs, however, the project was put on ice Stefan wasn&apos;t happy with the way Simon Says sounded and when both he and Daniel moved they suddenly were too far away from each other to be able to continue anyhow. Daniel started studying philosophy, then drifted off to India and the Middle East for two long periods. Meanwhile, Stefan focused on his role as bass player in his other band, Wagnerian space rockers The Moor, with whom he cut Flux in 1996. &#10;&#10;So, while Daniel was studying sitar in India, Stefan and The Moor toured Europe with legendary singer/flute and sax player Nik Turner of Hawkwind. Then, in 2001, Stefan felt he had somehow written a new Simon Says album. Guitarist Jonas Hallberg, Stefan&apos;s stand-in on bass in The Moor, was recruited, as well as Mattias Jarlhed (from Valinor&apos;s Tree) who recorded the drum parts only four days after having been invited to join. &#10;&#10;After four weeks Paradise Square was finished and a deal with Galileo records was struck. The album was released in July 2002 and was met by everything between very good and rave reviews. But after eight months of sporadic rehearsals the band was shelved. Again. &#10;&#10;Stefan refused to give Simon Says up, though. In spite of a series of domestic problems culminating in a tragic divorce he dedicated every spare second to write and record new music. And so, the band has in the last years contributed to a series of Musea samplers while all the time working on the main project: the one about survival. Tardigrade. &#10;&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Says&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<summary>The Limp Twins are Will Holland (a.k.a quantic) and Russell Porter, who created their album tales from beyond the groove (TRUCD057, 2003) in their bedrooms (according to the cd cover). The record is a funky offering somewhere in between the sound of Will Holland&apos;s other projects, quantic and the quantic soul orchestra, but is definately more laid back. &#10;&#10;For more information on this project, check out quantic&apos;s website: about The Limp Twins. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/The+Limp+Twins&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

<content>Curtis Ousley (February 7, 1934 – August 13, 1971), who performed under the stage name King Curtis, was an American saxophone virtuoso known for rhythm and blues, rock and roll, soul, blues, funk and soul jazz. Variously a bandleader, band member, and session musician, he was also a musical director and record producer. Adept at tenor, alto, and soprano saxophone, he was best known for his distinctive riffs and solos such as on The Coasters - Yakety Yak, which later became the inspiration for Boots Randolph&apos;s &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; and his own &quot;Memphis Soul Stew&quot;.&#10;&#10;Curtis Ousley was adopted, with his sister, Josephine Ousley Allen. They were raised together in Fort Worth, Texas. Ousley attended I.M. Terrell High School, and studied and performed music with schoolmate Ornette Coleman.&#10;&#10;Ousley started playing saxophone at the age of twelve in the Fort Worth area. He took interest in many musical genres including jazz, rhythm and blues, and popular music. As a student pursuing music, he turned down college scholarships in order to join the Lionel Hampton Band. During his time with Hampton, he was able to write and arrange music and learn guitar. In 1952 Curtis decided to move to New York and became a session musician, recording for such labels as Prestige, Enjoy, Capitol, and Atco. He recorded with Nat Adderley, Wynton Kelly, Buddy Holly, Waylon Jennings and Andy Williams.&#10;&#10;Stylistically, Curtis took inspiration from saxophonists Lester Young, Louis Jordan, Illinois Jacquet, Earl Bostic, and Gene Ammons. Known for his syncopated and percussive style, he was both versatile and powerful as a musician. He put together a group during his time as a session musician that included Richard Tee, Cornell Dupree, Jerry Jemmott, and Bernard Purdie.&#10;&#10;King Curtis enjoyed playing jazz and rhythm &amp; blues but decided he would make more money as a rhythm &amp; blues musician, stating in a 1971 interview with Charlie Gillet that &quot;I love the authentic rhythm &amp; blues more than anything, and I also like to live well.&quot; From the 1950s until the mid-1960s, he worked as a session player, recording under his own name and with others such as the Coasters, with whom he recorded &quot;Yakety Yak.&quot; Buddy Holly hired him for session work, during which they recorded &quot;Reminiscing.&quot; Holly wrote this song, but gave Curtis the songwriting credit for flying down to the session. His best-known singles from this period are &quot;Soul Twist&quot; and &quot;Soul Serenade.&quot; He provided backing on a number of songs for LaVern Baker, including her 1958 hit single &quot;I Cried a Tear&quot;, where his saxophone became &quot;a second voice&quot;.&#10;&#10;In 1965, he moved to Atlantic Records and recorded his most successful singles, &quot;Memphis Soul Stew&quot; and &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; (1967). He worked with The Coasters, led Aretha Franklin&apos;s backing band The Kingpins. The Kingpins opened for The Beatles during their 1965 performance at Shea Stadium. Curtis produced records, often working with Jerry Wexler and recorded for Groove Records during this period, including the Joe South song &quot;Games People Play&quot; with guitarist Duane Allman.&#10;&#10;In March 1971 he appeared with Aretha Franklin and The Kingpins at the Fillmore West, which resulted in two live albums: Aretha Live at Fillmore West, and Curtis&apos; own Live at Fillmore West. In July 1971, Curtis recorded saxophone solos on &quot;It&apos;s So Hard&quot; and &quot;I Don&apos;t Wanna Be a Soldier&quot; from John Lennon&apos;s Imagine. Along with The Rimshots, he recorded the original theme song for the 1971 hit television show, Soul Train, titled &quot;Hot Potatoes.&quot;&#10;&#10;Curtis was killed on August 13, 1971 when he was stabbed during an argument with a pair of drug dealers he discovered on the steps outside his Manhattan apartment. Curtis was attempting to carry an air conditioner into his apartment when Juan Montanez refused to move from the entrance. A fight ensued and Montanez stabbed Curtis. Curtis later died at Roosevelt Hospital. In March 1972, Montanez was sentenced to seven years for second-degree manslaughter, but was released in late 1977 for good behavior.&#10;&#10;On the day of Curtis&apos; funeral Atlantic Records closed their offices. Jesse Jackson administered the service and as the mourners filed in, Curtis&apos; band &apos;The Kingpins&apos; played &quot;Soul Serenade&quot;. Among those attending were Ousley&apos;s immediate family, including sister Josephine Ousley Allen, other family members, Aretha Franklin, Cissy Houston, Brook Benton and Duane Allman. Franklin sang the closing spiritual &quot;Never Grow Old&quot; and Stevie Wonder performed &quot;Abraham, Martin and John and now King Curtis&quot;.&#10;&#10;Curtis was subsequently buried in a red granite-fronted wall crypt in the &apos;West Gallery of Forsythia Court&apos; mausoleum at Pinelawn Memorial Park in Farmingdale, New York, the same cemetery that holds jazz greats Count Basie and John Coltrane.&#10;&#10;In 1970, a year before his death, Curtis won the Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance Grammy for &quot;Games People Play&quot;.&#10;&#10;Curtis was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 6, 2000.&#10;&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/King+Curtis&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>The Quantic Soul Orchestra is a live funk project initiated by Will Holland, aka Quantic, which eschews the use of samples in favour of a rawer &apos;70s sound. Considered one of the main acts in the modern funk movement.&#10;&#10;Releases&#10;- Stampede (2003)&#10;- Pushin&apos; On (2005)&#10;- I&apos;m Thankful (2006)&#10;- Tropidélico (2007)&#10;&#10;&quot;Putting something back&quot; is how Will Holland described the reason for starting The Quantic Soul Orchestra. Having released two succesful albums on Tru Thoughts under his Quantic guise - The 5th Exotic and Apricot Morning (which fused jazzy and breakbeat sounds), he felt his next musical adventure would be to focus on the album Stampede. The Quantic Soul Orchestra is a live project, strictly no samples allowed. Influenced by Mr Holland&apos;s love of the dusty funk 45&apos;s, he wanted to record and produce an album with creative and like minded musicians.&#10;&#10;With pop acts in the 2000s now using hip-hop beats (beats which are heavily influenced by funk records from the 70s) it was important for the QSO to make their sound rough, raw and real - it&apos;s definitely not Acid Jazz but has a deeper funk sound that shows that this music is well and truly alive in the new millennium. Their album Stampede was influenced by the many flamboyant (but often poor) musicians in the 70s who loved music for music&apos;s sake, who wanted to dance and make people dance.&#10;&#10;They are not trying to be retro and trendy, hence the cover version of 4 Hero&apos;s future soul anthem from 2002 Hold It Down. Sung in one take as vocalist Alice Russell warmed up before a recording session, it was decided that the original Holland penned instrumental should be replaced with this version. Ms Russell also lends her soulful voice to two other tracks on Stampede Something That&apos;s Real and Take Your Time, Change Your Mind. The other sung track finds John Hughes adding vocals (as well as some guitar and flute) to the classic QSO 7&quot; Super 8. The QSO also adds Afro Beat, Soul and Jazz influences to the Funk sound with musicians Dave Woodhouse (Clavinet, Rhodes and Trumpet), Damian Bell (Trombone), Antonia Pheulatos (String Arrangements and Violin), Lucy Holland (Saxophone), Richard Gibbs (Drums) and of course Will Holland himself (Guitars, Bass and Percussion) adding to the variety.&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/The+Quantic+Soul+Orchestra&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Anthony B is the stage name of Keith Blair (born March 31, 1976), a Jamaican musician.&#10;&#10;Blair grew up in rural Clarks Town in the northwestern parish of Trelawny. His deeply religious family life (his mother was a Seventh-day Adventist and his grandmother a Revivalist) imbued him with a profound spirituality. During his youth, his favorite singers were reggae legends Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer, musicians who strongly influenced his own style. Peter Tosh&apos;s influence can definitely be heard in Anthony B&apos;s vocal delivery and revolutionary stance.&#10;&#10;Anthony B adopted Rastafarian beliefs as a teenager, a decision which was not well-received by his family. The stubborn and determined Anthony B refused to give up his new religion and his dreadlocks and moved to the home of his aunt and uncle in the Kingston suburb, Portmore.&#10;&#10;While attending high school, Anthony B debuted as a deejay for the local sound system, Shaggy Hi-Power. In 1988, he befriended reggae artists such as Determine, Mega Banton, Ricky General and Terror Fabulous.&#10;&#10;At this point in the reggae industry, singing &quot;slack&quot; songs about women was the popular thing to do. Anthony B did not believe in degrading women and chose to pen politically-slanted songs rather than so-called &quot;gyal chunes.&quot; He hooked up with Little Devon the Half Pint sound-a-like singer he made his debut single &quot;The Living is Hard&quot; on the Wizard label in 1993. Anthony B tried many different producers but found that none of them fit his style of music. Finally, Anthony B teamed up with Richard &quot;Bello&quot; Bell, creating hits such as Fire Pon Rome, Raid Di Barn, Rumour, and Repentance Time. Anthony B&apos;s 1996 debut album Real Revolutionary was highly acclaimed in the reggae community. In late 1997, Anthony B released Universal Struggle which showed that Anthony B had a consistent, high-calibre talent. Anthony B has released a large number of albums since that time including 1999&apos;s Seven Seals and 2004&apos;s Untouchable which featured collaborations with artists including Wyclef Jean.&#10;&#10;Anthony B tours extensively in Europe and North America and is known for his fiery, high-energy performances.&#10;&#10;Anthony B is a member of the Bobo Ashanti branch of the Rastafarian movement. &quot;Bobo Dreads&quot;, as they are known, are recognizable by their long robes and turbans. The strong Afrocentric pride and the other Rastafarian beliefs (or &quot;overstandings&quot; as Rastafarians prefer to call them) which Anthony B holds are reflected in his songs.&#10;&#10;Discography&#10;&#10;    * Predator &amp; Prey (1996, Alpha Enterprises)&#10;    * Real Revolutionary / So Many Things (1996, Greensleeves)&#10;    * Universal Struggle (1997, VP Records)&#10;    * Seven Seals (1999, VP Records)&#10;    * That&apos;s Life (2001, VP Records)&#10;    * More Love (2001, AO ! Records)&#10;    * Live On The Battlefield (2002, Jahmin&apos; Records)&#10;    * Reggae Max (2002, Jet Star)&#10;    * Street Knowledge (2003, Nocturne)&#10;    * Judgment Time (2003, 2B1 Records)&#10;    * Smoke Free (2003, Bogalusa Records)&#10;    * Voice Of Jamaica vol. 2 (2003, Nocturne)&#10;    * Wise Man Chant (2004, Black Scorpio)&#10;    * Justice Fight (2004, Nocturne)&#10;    * Untouchable (2004, Togetherness Records)&#10;    * Power Of Creation (2004, Nocturne)&#10;    * Black Star (2005, Greensleeves)&#10;    * My Hope (2005, AL.TA.FA.AN. / Minor 7 Flat 5) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+B&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>There are at least two artists that have used this name:&#10;1. A roots reggae band from Jamaica&#10;2. A straight edge metalcore band from Florida, US&#10;&#10;1. Culture was a Jamaican roots reggae group founded in 1976. Originally they were known as the African Disciples.&#10;&#10;The members of the trio were Joseph Hill (lead vocals), Albert Walker (backing vocals) and Kenneth Dayes (backing vocals).&#10;&#10;Shortly after Culture came together, they began working with the &quot;Mighty Two&quot; – producer Joe Gibbs and engineer Errol Thompson. While at Gibbs’ studio, they recorded a series of powerful singles, many of which ended up on their debut album ‘Two Sevens Clash’. After their success with Gibbs, the group went on to make a string of albums for producer Sonia Pottinger. Culture began working with some of the premier musicians of the day including Robbie Shakespeare, Sly Dunbar, Ansel Collins, Cedric Brooks and the ever-present percussionist Sticky. Virgin Records picked up the albums, and that added distribution enabled Culture to gain an even larger following outside of Jamaica.&#10;&#10;Critically considered one of the most authentic traditional reggae acts, at the time of the first Rolling Stone Record Guide publication, they were the only band of any genre whose every recording received a five-star review (of bands with more than one recording in the guide).&#10;&#10;In 1982 the three singers went their own ways. Hill carried on using the Culture name, and recorded the Lion Rock album, which was released in the United States by Heartbeat Records. For their part, Walker and Dayes recorded a handful of songs on their own – a few of which turned up on an album titled Roots &amp; Culture. In 1986 the original line-up reformed to record two highly regarded albums – Culture in Culture and Culture at Work. These releases marked the beginning of a very busy period for the group, including annual albums and countless tours. The U.S. label Shanachie released a steady stream of new and old Culture albums up to Wings Of A Dove in 1992.&#10;&#10;Joseph Hill, who came to symbolize the face of Culture, died in Germany on 19 August 2006 while the group was on tour. His son, Kenyatta Hill, now is the lead singer.&#10;&#10;2) Classic mid/late 90s hardcore from Florida, celebrated for, among a handful of others, helping to cultivate the burgeoning metallic hardcore sound that became synonymous with the era.&#10;&#10;CULTURE was known for aggressive social/political/ecological commentary, cautionary tales of reckless consumerism and industrial sprawl, and advocacy of the straightedge lifestyle.&#10;&#10;Former members went on to Morning Again, Terror, As Friends Rust, Shai Hulud, Throwdown, Blood Has Been Shed and (most recently) ON BODIES.&#10;&#10;In 2012, CULTURE played its first show since disbanding in 1998 (The Reel &amp; Restless Fest in Miami, Florida). This fall, in August of 2013, the band will revisit Europe for Belgium&apos;s famed Ieper Hardcore Festival, and will then play three dates in Japan, including Tokyo&apos;s Bloodaxe Fest.&#10;&#10;Members included:&#10;&#10;Rich Thurston (Guitar: 1993-1997, Bass: 1993, Vocals: 1993, Drums: 1996)&#10;Josh Williams (Drums: 1993-1997)&#10;Stan Obal (Bass: 1993)&#10;Mark Mitchell (Vocals: 1993, Vocals: 1996)&#10;Pete Carreno (Bass: 1994)&#10;John Wylie (Guitar: 1994-1995)&#10;Damien Moyal (Vocals: 1994-1995, Vocals: 1997-1998)&#10;Gordon Tarpley (Bass: 1995-1997, Guitar: 1998)&#10;Louie Long (Vocals: 1995)&#10;Anthony Conte (Vocals: 1995)&#10;Steve Looker (Guitar: 1996-1997)&#10;Jason Dooley (Drums: 1997)&#10;Timothy Kirkpatrick (Drums: 1997-1998)&#10;Joe Simmons (Guitar:1997-1998)&#10;Floyd Beckham (Bass: 1998)&#10;Kenneth Brian (Guitar: 1998)&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Culture&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Naggo Morris&#10;Biography&#10;&#10;Naggo Morris, given name Dolphin George Morris.Born of Vernal Naggo Morris and Ivy Morris on September 30, 1947, in Carron Hall, St. Mary.  Moved to Kingston at two weeks old. Lived at Chisholm Ave for all his childhood years and into adulthood.  He is proud to mention that he attended Miss Allen’s school then Rousssea school at Ricketts Ave, Kingston 13.&#10;His dad was an avid musician/entertainer who at times made folks cried when he played his saxophone, so he fell in love with the entertainment business from observing him. He started out as a dancer with a group called the Coaster with Coupland Forbes, and Lenord Mundy. They worked with Luis Bennett and Ranny Williams on TV shows such as Sounds of the Seventies, Mambo Tam Boo, Ring Ding and Coozie Corner. They also did Christmas Morning shows at Carib Theatre, Regal Magestic Theatre and State Theatre in Kingston, Strand and Palladium Theatre  in Montego Bay. Fine start to life in the entertainment business especially working with the great Luis Bennett.&#10;Dancing was not enough for the multi talented Naggo Morris. He moved on to join a singing group called the Morwells,  then moved to the Royals with whom they did albums such as,  Pick up the Peices, and Conference Table. I also did some harmony for studio 1 recording studio with a group called the Soul Boys (Barrington Spence and Junior Zun).  They did a few songs for down beat/ studio one then moved to Treasure Isle recording studio where we worked along side Stranger Cole, Alton Ellis,  Slim Smith,  The Technique, The Unique and others.  He then went on to doing  a single called Say You (Adapted) for Prince Toney on the front line recording label. He also did vocals on an album called Rasta Ambassador with U-Roy who DJ. &#10; Some of his major hits were Here I Come with Clappas Record, the renowned Su Su Pan Rasta and Jah guide with Joe Gibbs and of course these were all number one hits on the charts. The riddim for Su Su Pan Rasta was so huge that Prince Far I did a song called Heavy Manner’s on it and which was a big hit too  He also did One Meal on the Joe Gibbs Label. During this time he  did backing vocals with Lloyd Parks of We the people band and Rudy Thomas May his soul rest in Peace.  Some of his most treasured moments were working alongside Dennis Brown,  Gregory Isaacs and Bob Andy with whom they produce multiple hit songs.&#10;In 1974 he did the hit song Flour Power which was inspired by cases of people being poisoned by flour contaminated with rat poison in Jamaica. This took the entertainment industry by storm and continues to be a well loved song.&#10;Being the very accomplished roots singer he was it wasno mistake when the Heptones recruited him to replace Leroy Sibbles after he migrated in 1975. His deep roots style perfectly complimented the Heptones (Earl Morgan, Barry Llewellyn) keen harmony As lead singer for the Heptones they were the first to grace the stages of  the first Reggae Sun Splash that came to Jarrett Park Montego bay. It was a real honor for him to be apart of such a momentous  event in the history of Jamaican reggae music. They opened the show billed with top artist such as Bob Marley, Ken Booth Alton Ellis and many others. It was the first performance but not the last. They also performed  in the 1982 at the Catherine Hall Bob Marley Center. &#10;The Heptones recorded a song for Channel one called, “How Could I Leave,” and others but Paulie(owner of channel) died and those songs weren’t released but played on dub plate.  Dennis Brown re-recorded the same song How Could I Leave on the Joe Gibbs label and it became number one.  Despite this the Heptones kept going. They  did an album  called , “Better Days” for Winston Niney Holliness  Boswell  then they went to England on tour in 1975. The Heptones toured Europe, Canada and the USA. One of Naggo’s  most treasured memory is visiting Scotland and seeing men wearing skirts with their bag pipes a big cultural difference.    &#10;He has worked with musicians such as Ansell Collins (key boards), Lloyd Park(Bass), Robbie Shaekespear(Bass), Sly Dunbar(drums), Frankie Bubbler (Organ), Ranchie McLean (guitarist), Ricka Backa (guitarist), Bongo Herman (percussion), Frank Aird aka Blazing Frank (trumpet), Vin Gordon (trombone), Deadly Headley( alto horns), &#10;My new album Everyday Life a Morris Must production will be out soon. Songs written by him, but four in combination with Vivia Morris, backing vocals Earl Morgan, Barringtong Llewellyn and Naggo lead vocalist. The album was arranged by The Heptones, Vivia Morris, Errol Morris and Mitchell Morris.&#10;He gives thanks to  Winston Holliness and Larry MacDonald  for producing most of his music.  Thanks to Earl Morgan and Barry Llewellyn for the opportunity to work with them . A special thank you to Roy Francis from the mixing lab studios.&#10;Naggo Morris continues to perform with the Heptones and to do solo acts. He is now making preparations for shows in Canada, USA, Europe and Brazil.&#10;&#10;For Booking and Reservations:&#10;Contact: Vivia Morris&#10; Manager:&#10;Telephone: 1-763-568-6067.&#10;E-Mail: viviamanda@hotmail.com&#10;Skype: vivia.morris&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Naggo+Morris&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>With the tragic murder of Hugh Mundell, who was shot and killed while sitting in a car with Junior Reid, reggae lost one of its most promising young performers. Mundell&apos;s 1978 debut album, Africa Must Be Free By 1983, produced by Augustus Pablo, in Jamaica remains a classic roots reggae recording. Mundell&apos;s singing style and soothing voice will lull you into tranquility if you let it. &#10;&#10;Mundell, the son of a prominent Jamaican lawyer, was still a teenager when he teamed with influential producer Joe Gibbs to record a still-unreleased single, &quot;&apos;Where Is Natty Dread.&quot; His first break came when he was hired as a DJ for Augustus Pablo&apos;s Rockers sound system. His debut single, &quot;Africa Must Be Free by 1983&quot;, produced by Augustus Pablo, was released in early 1978. Mundell also recorded several 12&quot; singles as Jah Levi. &#10;&#10;Mundell continued recording with Pablo. The albums Time &amp; Place and Blackman&apos;s Foundation followed shortly after, and then a few tracks for Prince Jammy were gathered together along with some of Lacksley Castell&apos;s, put on an album and called Jah Fire. &#10;&#10;Beginning in 1979, Mundell took over the production of his own recordings. He released his Mundell album on Greensleeves in 1982. He also produced the debut album, Speak the Truth, by &quot;Little&quot; Junior Reid, on Pablo&apos;s label, Rockers. &#10;&#10;In 1983 he became involved in an argument and was shot in the neck. Shortly afterwards, his posthumous album Arise was released. A dub version of Africa Must Be Free By 1983 was released in 1989 and then packaged with the original by Greensleeves and RAS, and then Makasound packaged Time &amp; Place and Blackman&apos;s Foundation together and released it as The Blessed Youth in 2003. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Hugh+Mundell&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Jamaican ska vocal group The Maytals became a reggae band 1971, renamed Toots and The Maytals with Frederick &quot;Toots&quot; Hibbert as front figure. The band got a Grammy award 2005 for the album True Love. Funky Kingston in early 70s is on Rolling Stone&apos;s list The Greatest Albums of All Time. Bass line in &apos;54-46 That&apos;s My Number&apos; is one of the most covered in pop music. &apos;Monkey Man&apos;, &apos;Pressure Drop&apos;, &apos;Bam Bam&apos;, etc, made them to favorites for the early skinhead movement of white working-class youth in UK.  &#10;- - -&#10;&#10;Toots and The Maytals  are from Kingston, Jamaica. It was the producer Byron Lee who 1971 renamed them Toots &amp; the Maytals. Frederick &quot;Toots&quot; Hibbert, the leader of the group and the lead singer, was born in May Pen in the Parish of Clarendon, Jamaica. He was the youngest of seven children. He grew up singing gospel music in a church choir, but moved to Kingston in 1961 at the age of sixteen.&#10;&#10;In Kingston, he met Henry &quot;Raleigh&quot; Gordon and Nathaniel &quot;Jerry&quot; McCarthy, forming a group whose early recordings were attributed to &quot;The Flames&quot; and, possibly, &quot;The Vikings&quot;. Having renamed the group the Maytals, the vocal trio recorded their first album, &quot;Never Grow Old - presenting the Maytals&quot;, for producer Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd at Studio One in 1962-63. With musical backing from Dodd&apos;s house band, the legendary Skatalites, the Maytals&apos; close-harmony gospel singing ensured instant success for the 1964 release, overshadowing Dodd&apos;s other up-and-coming gospel trio, The Wailers. The original album augmented by studio out-takes from the Studio One sessions was re-released by Heartbeat/Rounder Records in 1997, and is essential listening for Maytals and Skatalites fans.&#10;&#10;After staying at Studio One for about two years, the group moved on to do sessions for Prince Buster (released in 1974) before recording their second album produced by Byron Lee in 1965. However, the band&apos;s musical career was rudely interrupted in late 1966 when Hibbert was arrested and imprisoned on drug possession charges.&#10;&#10;Following Hibbert&apos;s release from jail towards the end of 1967, the band officially changed their name to Toots and the Maytals and began working with Chinese-Jamaican producer Leslie Kong, a collaboration which produced three classic albums and a string of hits throughout the late sixties and early seventies - &quot;Do the Reggay&quot;, a 1968 single widely credited with coining the word reggae, &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, &quot;54-46 was my number&quot; and &quot;Monkey Man&quot;, the group&apos;s first international hit in 1970. The group was featured in one of reggae&apos;s greatest breakthrough events - The Harder They Come, the 1972 film and soundtrack starring Jimmy Cliff.&#10;&#10;Following Kong&apos;s death in 1971, the group continued to record with Kong&apos;s former sound engineer, Warwick Lyn; produced by Lyn and Chris Blackwell of Island Records, the group released three best-selling albums, and enjoyed international hits with &quot;Funky Kingston&quot; in 1973 and &quot;Reggae Got Soul&quot; in 1976.&#10;&#10;Toots and the Maytals&apos; compositions would be given a second airing in 1978-80 during the reggae-punk and ska revival period in the UK, when the Specials included &quot;Monkey Man&quot; on their 1979 debut album and the Clash produced their version of &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, with other Maytals&apos; covers being recorded by Sublime. Having toured throughout the world for many years, Toots and the Maytals disbanded in the early 1980s, but reformed in the early 90s to continue touring and recording successfully.&#10;&#10;The band recently won the 2005 Grammy award for reggae for the album True Love, an album consisting of re-recorded versions of their classics alongside popular and legendary musicians such as Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, and Keith Richards, as well as popular artists today such as No Doubt, Ben Harper, The Roots, and Shaggy.&#10;&#10;They also contributed to the Easy Star All-Stars album &apos;Radiodread&apos; (a dub tribute to Radiohead&apos;s OK Computer). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Toots+and+The+Maytals&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Michelle Lynn Johnson officially changed her professional name from Me&apos;Shell NdegéOcello to simply Meshell Ndegeocello, with the release of her 2001 album, &quot;Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape&quot;.&#10;&#10;Meshell Ndegeocello (b. August 29, 1968) is a singer, bassist, and multi-instrumentalist. She was born Michelle Johnson to Army lieutenant (and saxophonist) father Jacques Johnson and her mother, Helen in Berlin, Germany.&#10;&#10;Raised in Washington, D.C., Meshell Suihailia Bashir Shakur (as she became known) adopted the surname Ndegeocello, which means &quot;free like a bird&quot;, while still in her teens. She has been hailed in the music press as a redeemer of soul music. Her music incorporates funk, soul, hip-hop, reggae, rock and jazz. She has been nominated for 9 Grammys. She has frequently toured with Lilith Fair.&#10;&#10;Ndegeocello honed her chops on the D.C. Go go circuit in the late 1980s before venturing out as a solo artist. She emerged as a recording artist in 1993 on Maverick Records/Sire Records with her debut, Plantation Lullabies. This recording presented a distinctly androgynous persona. Her music has been featured in a number of film soundtracks including How Stella Got Her Groove Back and Batman and Robin. She has also appeared on recordings by Basement Jaxx and The Blind Boys of Alabama, among others. Her biggest hit is a duet with John Cougar Mellencamp, a cover version of Van Morrison&apos;s &quot;Wild Night&quot;, which reached #3 on the Billboard charts.&#10;&#10;Her singles &quot;If That&apos;s Your Boyfriend (He Wasn&apos;t Last Night)&quot;, &quot;Leviticus: Faggot&quot;, and her cover of Bill Withers &quot;Who Is He and What Is He To You?&quot; have all charted in the Billboard top 20. She sang background vocals on the song &quot;I&apos;d Rather be Your Lover&quot; by Madonna, on her album &quot;Bedtime Stories.&quot;. She also sang with Chaka Khan on the single &quot;Never Miss the Water&quot;, as well as providing her typical solid bass skills.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Meshell+Ndegeocello&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Steven Paul &quot;Elliott&quot; Smith (August 6, 1969 – October 21, 2003) was an American songwriter and musician. Smith was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and resided for a significant portion of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he first gained popularity. His primary instrument was the guitar, but he was also proficient at piano, clarinet, bass, drums and harmonica. Smith had a distinctive vocal style characterized by his &quot;whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery&quot; and use of multi-tracking to create vocal harmonies.&#10;&#10;After playing in the rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994 with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars. In 1997 he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, included in the soundtrack for the film Good Will Hunting, was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category in 1997.&#10;&#10;Smith battled with depression, alcoholism and drug addiction for years, and these topics often appeared in his lyrics. At age 34, he died in Los Angeles, California from two stab wounds to the chest. The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, From a Basement on the Hill, which was released posthumously on October 19, 2004.&#10;&#10;Early life&#10;&#10;Steven Paul Smith was born at Clarkson Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska. His mother, Bunny Welch (née Bunny Kay Berryman), was a music teacher at an elementary school, and his father, Gary Smith, was a University of Nebraska medical student at the time. His parents divorced about a year later, and Smith moved with his mother to live in Duncanville, Texas. Much later in his life, Smith got a tattoo of a map of Texas on his upper arm and said, &quot;I didn&apos;t get it because I like Texas, kinda the opposite. But I won&apos;t forget about it although I&apos;m tempted to &apos;cause I don&apos;t like it there.&quot; Smith endured a difficult childhood and a troubled relationship with his stepfather Charlie. Smith reflected the impact of this part of his life in the lyrics of &quot;Some Song&quot;: &quot;Charlie beat you up week after week, and when you grow up you&apos;re going to be a freak.&quot; The name &quot;Charlie&quot; also appeared in the lyrics for &quot;Flowers for Charlie&quot; and &quot;No Confidence Man&quot;. The family was a part of the Community of Christ through much of Smith&apos;s childhood, but eventually began attending services at a local Methodist Church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him &quot;really scared of hell&quot;. In a 2001 interview, he stated, &quot;I don&apos;t necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But I have my own version of it&quot;. At the age of nine, Smith began playing the piano, and at ten began learning guitar on a small acoustic guitar bought for him by his father. At this age he also composed an original piano piece, &quot;Fantasy,&quot; which won him a prize at an arts festival. Many of the people on his mother&apos;s side of the family were non-professional musicians; his grandfather was a Dixieland drummer and his grandmother sang in a glee club.&#10;&#10;At 14, Smith moved from Texas to Portland, Oregon, to live with his father, who was then working as a psychiatrist. It was around this time that Smith first began trying drugs and alcohol with friends as well as experimenting with recording for the first time, borrowing a four-track recorder. During high school, Smith played clarinet in the school band and also played guitar, piano and sang in the bands Stranger Than Fiction, A Murder of Crows and The Greenhouse, billed as either Steven Smith or &quot;Johnny Panic&quot;. He graduated from Lincoln High School as a National Merit Scholar.&#10;&#10;After graduation, Steven Smith began calling himself &quot;Elliott&quot;, saying that he thought &quot;Steve&quot; sounded too much like a &quot;jock&quot; name, and that &quot;Steven&quot; sounded &quot;too bookish&quot;. Biographer S. R. Shutt speculates that it was either inspired by Elliott Avenue, a street that Smith had lived on in Portland, or that it was suggested by his then-girlfriend. A junior high acquaintance of Smith speculates that it was so as not to be confused with Steve Smith, the drummer of Journey.&#10;&#10;Heatmiser&#10;&#10;Smith graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1991 with a degree in philosophy and political science. &quot;Went straight through in four years,&quot; he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. &quot;I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn&apos;t want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, &apos;This is your one and only chance to go to college and you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.&apos; Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day.&quot; After he graduated he &quot;worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and legal theory.&quot; While at Hampshire, Smith formed the band Heatmiser with classmate Neil Gust. After graduating from Hampshire, the band added drummer Tony Lash and bassist Brandt Peterson and began performing around Portland in 1992. The group released the albums Dead Air (1993) and Cop and Speeder (1994) as well as the Yellow No. 5 EP (1994) on Frontier Records, and were then signed to Virgin Records to release what became their final album Mic City Sons (1996).&#10;&#10;Smith had begun his solo career while still in Heatmiser, and the success of his first two releases created distance and tension with his band. Heatmiser disbanded prior to Mic City Sons&apos; release, prompting Virgin to put the album out inauspiciously through its independent arm, Caroline Records. A clause in Heatmiser&apos;s record contract with Virgin meant that Smith was still bound to it as an individual. The contract was later bought-out by DreamWorks prior to the release of his album, XO.&#10;&#10;Roman Candle&#10;&#10;His first release, Roman Candle (1994), came about when Smith&apos;s girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of &quot;the most recent eight songs that [he’d] recorded on borrowed four-tracks and borrowed guitar&quot; to Cavity Search Records. Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was only expecting a deal for a seven-inch record. Regarding the record, Smith said &quot;I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular. [...] The thing is that album was really well-received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed Heatmiser unfortunately.&quot; Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: &quot;The idea of playing [my music] for people didn&apos;t occur to me... because at the time it was the Northwest – Mudhoney and Nirvana – and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off.&quot; The instrumentation of the recordings was primarily acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by brief electric guitar riffs or a small drum set played with brushes. Only the final track, an instrumental titled &quot;Kiwi Maddog 20/20&quot; (a reference to the bum wine MD 20/20), had full band instrumentation.&#10;&#10;Smith&apos;s debut solo performance was at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from Roman Candle were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set comprised of B-sides, Heatmiser tunes, and unreleased tracks. Soon after this performance, he was asked to open for Mary Lou Lord on a week-long U.S. tour. Several more short tours followed, and Smith helped her record one of his songs &quot;I Figured You Out&quot;, which he once called &quot;a stupid pop song [written] in about a minute&quot; that he discarded for &quot;[sounding] like the fucking Eagles.&quot;&#10;Elliott Smith and Either/Or&#10;&#10;In 1995, the self-titled album Elliott Smith was released on Kill Rock Stars; the record featured a similar style of recording to Roman Candle, but not without hints of growth and experimentation. Though the majority of the album was recorded by Smith alone, friend and Spinanes vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on &quot;St. Ides Heaven&quot;, and Heatmiser guitarist Neil Gust played guitar on &quot;Single File&quot;. Several songs made reference to drugs, but Smith explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being about drugs specifically. Looking back, Smith felt that the album&apos;s pervasive mood gave him &quot;a reputation for being a really dark, depressed person,&quot; and said that he later made a conscious move toward more diverse moods in his music.&#10;&#10;In 1996, filmmaker Jem Cohen recorded Smith playing acoustic songs for the short film Lucky Three: an Elliott Smith Portrait. Two of these songs would appear on his next album, Either/Or, another Kill Rock Stars release that came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing bass, drums, keyboards and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title was derived from the two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, which deals with such themes as existential despair, dread, death and God.&#10;&#10;By this time, Smith&apos;s already-heavy drinking was now being compounded with use of anti-depressants. At the end of the Either/Or tour, an intervention was staged by close friends of his in Chicago, but it proved ineffective.&#10;&#10;Miss Misery and the Oscars&#10;&#10;In 1996, Smith was tapped by director and fellow Portland resident Gus Van Sant to be a part of the soundtrack to his film, Good Will Hunting. Smith recorded an orchestral version of &quot;Between the Bars (Orchestral)&quot; with acclaimed composer Danny Elfman for the movie. Smith also contributed a new song, &quot;Miss Misery,&quot; and three other previously released tracks (&quot;No Name #3&quot;, from Roman Candle, and &quot;Angeles&quot; and &quot;Say Yes&quot;, from Either/Or). The film was a commercial and critical success, and Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for &quot;Miss Misery&quot;. Not eager to step into the limelight, he only agreed to perform the song at the ceremony after the producers informed him that his song would be played live that night — either by him or another musician of their choosing.&#10;&#10;On March 5, 1998, Smith made his network television debut on Late Night With Conan O&apos;Brien performing &quot;Miss Misery&quot; solo on acoustic guitar. A few days later, wearing a white suit, he played an abridged version of the song at the Oscars, accompanied by the house orchestra. James Horner and Will Jennings won the award that night for best song with &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; (sung by Celine Dion) from the film Titanic. Smith did not voice disappointment about not winning the award.&#10;&#10;Smith commented on the surrealism of the Oscars experience: &quot;That&apos;s exactly what it was, surreal... I enjoy performing almost as much as I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was a lot of people who didn&apos;t come to hear me play. I wouldn&apos;t want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day.&quot;&#10;XO and Figure 8&#10;&#10;In 1998, after the success of Either/Or and &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, Smith signed to a bigger independent record label, DreamWorks Records. Around the same time, Smith fell into depression, speaking openly of considering suicide, and on at least one occasion made a serious attempt at ending his own life. While in North Carolina, he became severely intoxicated and ran off a cliff. He landed on a tree, which badly impaled him but broke his fall. When questioned about his suicide attempt, he told an interviewer, &quot;Um, yeah – I jumped off a cliff. But it didn&apos;t work.&quot; Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which released Roman Candle), said about this time in Smith&apos;s life: &quot;I talked him out of thinking that he wanted to kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him.&quot; Smith&apos;s first release for DreamWorks was later that year. Titled XO, it was produced by the team of Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock. XO also contained some instrumentation from Los Angeles musicians Joey Waronker and Jon Brion. It contained a more full-sounding, baroque pop sound than any of his previous efforts, with songs featuring a horn section, Chamberlins and elaborate string arrangements and even a drum loop on the song &quot;Independence Day&quot;. His familiar double-tracked vocal and acoustic guitar style was still apparent. The album went on to peak at number 104 on the Billboard 200 and sold 400,000 copies (more than double that of each of his two Kill Rock Stars releases), becoming the best-selling release of his career. Smith&apos;s backing band during most of this period was the Portland-based group Quasi, consisting of former bandmate Sam Coomes on bass guitar and Coomes&apos;s ex-wife Janet Weiss on drums. Quasi also performed as the opening act at many shows on the tour, with Smith sometimes contributing bass, guitar or backing vocals. On October 17, 1998, Smith appeared on Saturday Night Live and performed &quot;Waltz #2.&quot; His backing band for this appearance was John Moen, Jon Brion, Rob Schnapf and Sam Coomes.&#10;&#10;In response to whether the change to a bigger record label would influence his creative control, Smith said: &quot;...sometimes people look at major labels as simply money-making machines, they&apos;re actually composed of individuals who are real people, and there&apos;s a part of them that needs to feel that part of their job is to put out good music.&quot; Smith also claimed in another interview that he never read his reviews for fear that they would interfere with his songwriting.&#10;&#10;Figure 8, which was released in 2000, featured the return of Rothrock, Schnapf, Brion, and Waronker, and was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in England. The album garnered generally positive reviews and peaked at number 99 on the Billboard 200. The album garnered praise for its power pop style and complex arrangements, described as creating a &quot;sweeping kaleidoscope of layered instruments and sonic textures.&quot; However, some reviewers felt that Smith&apos;s trademark dark and melancholy songwriting had lost some of its subtlety, with one reviewer likening some of the songs to &quot;the self-pitying complaints of an adolescent venting in his diary.&quot;&#10;&#10;Album art and promotional pictures showed Smith looking cleaned-up and put-together. An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, including television appearances on Late Night With Conan O&apos;Brien and The Late Show With David Letterman. However, Smith&apos;s condition began to deteriorate as he had become addicted to heroin either towards the end of or just after the Figure 8 tour.&#10;&#10;Final years and recording of From a Basement on the Hill&#10;&#10;A follow-up to Smith&apos;s 2000 album was originally planned to happen with Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded a substantial amount of music for the album, when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work up until that point. He later said: &quot;There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn&apos;t want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs.&quot; When Brion sent a bill for the abandoned sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer voiced what he believed to be intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith sent a message to the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell, a member of the band Goldenboy. McConnell told SPIN that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd (of The Flaming Lips) and Scott McPherson played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.&#10;&#10;One of the few highlights for Smith in 2001 was inclusion of his song &quot;Needle in the Hay&quot; in Wes Anderson&apos;s dark comedy The Royal Tenenbaums. The song plays during a suicide attempt. Smith was originally supposed to contribute a cover of The Beatles&apos; &quot;Hey Jude&quot; for the film, but when he failed to do so in time, Anderson had to use The Mutato Muzika Orchestra&apos;s version of the track instead. Anderson would later say that Smith &quot;was in a bad state&quot; at the time.&#10;&#10;Smith&apos;s live performances during 2001 and 2002 were infrequent, typically in the Pacific Northwest or Los Angeles. A review of his December 20, 2001 show at Portland&apos;s Crystal Ballroom stated concern over his appearance and performance: his hair was uncharacteristically greasy and long; his face was bearded and gaunt; and during his songs he exhibited alarming signs of &quot;memory-loss and butterfingers&quot;. The crowd would often have to shout out the lyrics (and in some cases, guitar chords) when Smith could not think of them.&#10;&#10;In the first of only three concerts performed in 2002, Smith co-headlined Northwestern University&apos;s &quot;A&amp;O Ball&quot; with Wilco on May 2 in Chicago. Smith&apos;s performance was described as &quot;undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician&quot; and an &quot;excruciating... nightmare&quot;. A reporter for the online magazine Glorious Noise made the statement &quot;...it would not surprise me at all if Elliott Smith ends up dead within a year.&quot;&#10;&#10;On November 25, 2002, Smith was involved in a brawl with the Los Angeles Police Department at a Flaming Lips/Beck concert. Smith later said he was defending a man he thought the police were harassing. Assuming that Smith was homeless, the officers allegedly beat and arrested him and his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba. The two spent the night in jail. Smith&apos;s hand and back were injured in the incident, causing him to cancel a number of shows. Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips and a friend of Smith&apos;s, stated concern over Smith&apos;s appearance and actions, saying that he &quot;saw a guy who had lost control of himself. He was needy, he was grumpy, he was everything you wouldn&apos;t want in a person. It&apos;s not like when you think of Keith Richards being pleasantly blissed out in the corner.&quot; Smith had attempted to go to rehab several times, but said he &quot;couldn&apos;t honestly do the first step... I couldn&apos;t say what you were supposed to say and mean it.&quot; In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center: &quot;What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you&apos;re on a drip bag, but the only thing that&apos;s in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I&apos;m not psychotic.&quot; After his 34th birthday on August 6, 2003, he gave up alcohol, caffeine, red meat, refined sugar and his longtime (sometimes abused) regimen of psychiatric medication. Director Mike Mills had been working with Smith during his final years and described Smith&apos;s troubles and apparent recovery: &quot;I gave the script to him, then he dropped off the face of the earth… He went through his whole crazy time, but by the time I was done with the film, he was making From a Basement on a Hill and I was shocked that he was actually making music.&quot; With things improving for Smith after several troubled years, he began experimenting with noise music and worked on his girlfriend Jennifer Chiba&apos;s iMac with the intent of learning how to record with computers, noting that it was the only method with which he was still unfamiliar. Smith jokingly labeled his experimental way of recording &quot;The California Frown&quot; (a play on the Beach Boys&apos; &quot;California Sound&quot;). He said of the songs: &quot;They&apos;re kind of more noisy with the pitch all distorted. Some are more acoustic, but there aren&apos;t too many like that. Lately I&apos;ve just been making up a lot of noise.&quot; He was also in the process of recording songs for the Thumbsucker soundtrack, including Big Star&apos;s &quot;Thirteen&quot;, and Cat Stevens&apos; &quot;Trouble&quot;. In August 2003, Suicide Squeeze Records put out a limited-edition vinyl single for &quot;Pretty (Ugly Before)&quot;, a song that Smith had been playing since the Figure 8 tour. Steve Hanft described the last six months of Smith&apos;s life as being &quot;like the light at the end of the tunnel&quot; and was convinced that Smith was clean and recovered.&#10;&#10;Death and reactions&#10;&#10;Elliott Smith died on October 21, 2003, at age 34 from two stab wounds to the chest. According to girlfriend Jennifer Chiba, with whom he was living at the time, the two were arguing, and she locked herself in the bathroom. Chiba heard him scream, and upon opening the door, saw Smith standing with a kitchen knife in his chest. She pulled the knife out, after which he collapsed and she called 911. Smith died in the hospital with the time of death listed as 1:36 p.m. While Smith&apos;s death was originally reported as a suicide, the official autopsy report released in December 2003 left open the question of possible homicide. A possible suicide note, written on a Post-it, read, &quot;I&apos;m so sorry—love, Elliott. God forgive me.&quot; According to Pitchfork, producer Larry Crane reported on his Tape Op message board that he had planned to help Smith mix his album in mid-November. Crane wrote: &quot;I hadn&apos;t talked to Elliott in over a year. His girlfriend, Jennifer, called me [last week] and asked if I&apos;d like to come to L.A. and help mix and finish [Smith&apos;s album]. I said yes, of course, and chatted with Elliott for the first time in ages. It seems surreal that he would call me to finish an album and then a week later kill himself. I talked to Jennifer this morning, who was obviously shattered and in tears, and she said, &apos;I don&apos;t understand, he was so healthy.&quot; The coroner&apos;s report revealed that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol were found in his system at the time of his death. The coroner did find anti-depressant and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder medications in his system, but at prescribed levels. With his death not being officially declared a suicide, a journalist noted that some have suspected foul play, but also that the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.&#10;&#10;Soon after his death, a fan memorial was initiated outside of Solutions Audio (4334 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California), the site at which the cover of the Figure 8 album was shot. Farewell messages to Smith were written on the wall, flowers were brought and photos, candles and empty bottles of alcohol mentioned in Smith&apos;s songs were left. The owner of Solutions has, as of April 2008, allowed the memorial to stand. Memorial concerts were held in several cities in America and England. A petition was soon put forth with intent to make part of the Silver Lake area a memorial park in Smith&apos;s honor. It received over 10,000 signatures, but no plans to go forth with the park have been announced. Another memorial is located inside Smith&apos;s former high school, Lincoln High, and was erected in July 2006.&#10;&#10;Since Smith&apos;s death, many musical acts have paid him tribute. Songs in tribute to, or about Smith have been released by Rilo Kiley (&quot;Ripchord&quot; and &quot;It Just Is&quot; on More Adventurous), Sparta (&quot;Bombs and Us&quot;), Ben Folds (&quot;Late&quot; on Songs for Silverman), Third Eye Blind (&quot;Elliott Smith&quot; on Symphony of Decay), Mary Lorson (&quot;Lonely Boy&quot; on Realistic), Rhett Miller (&quot;The Believer&quot; on The Believer), Earlimart (&quot;Heaven Adores You&quot; on Treble and Tremble), Pete Yorn (&quot;Bandstand in the Sky&quot; on Nightcrawler, a song jointly dedicated to Jeff Buckley), and Ginger Sling (&quot;Faith&quot; on the &quot;Room&quot; EP). Several tribute albums have been released since his death: To: Elliott From: Portland, Home to Oblivion: Elliott Smith Tribute, Remote Memory: A Tribute to Elliott Smith, A Tribute to Elliott Smith and The String Quartet Tribute to Elliott Smith.&#10;&#10;Posthumous releases&#10;&#10;From a Basement on the Hill, with almost four years in production, was released October 19, 2004 by ANTI- Records (a part of Epitaph Records). With Smith&apos;s family in control of his estate, they chose to bring in Rob Schnapf and Smith&apos;s ex-girlfriend Joanna Bolme to sort through and mix the album. Although predicted by Smith to be a double album (or a regular album with a &quot;bonus disc&quot;), it was released as a 15-track single album. Many of the darkest songs from the sessions (later leaked onto the Internet) were not included, such as &quot;True Love&quot; (which deals graphically with addiction and rehab), &quot;Abused&quot;, &quot;Stickman&quot; and &quot;Suicide Machine&quot; (a reworking of the Figure 8 era unreleased instrumental, &quot;Tiny Time Machine&quot;). It is rumored that it was the family&apos;s wishes not to have these songs on the record, as they had the final say in what should and should not be released. Reviews of the album were mostly very positive, but some were more critical; The Onion&apos;s A.V. Club wrote that &quot;the album he left behind turns out to be messy, complicated, and unquestionably not his defining work...the album still earns its place—not at the top, and unfortunately as a bookend—in a jarringly important body of work.&quot; Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing, a biography by Benjamin Nugent, was rushed to publication and hit stores shortly after From a Basement on the Hill, barely beyond the first anniversary of the musician&apos;s death. Smith&apos;s family, as well as Joanna Bolme, Jennifer Chiba, Neil Gust, Sam Coomes, and Janet Weiss, all declined to be interviewed and did not support the publication of the book. It contained interviews with Rob Schnapf, David McConnell, and Pete Krebs. The book received mixed reviews, with Publishers Weekly remarking that while &quot;Nugent manages to patch together the major beats of Smith&apos;s life, he can offer little meaningful insight&quot; and that Smith&apos;s fans &quot;will be disappointed by this short and shallow biography.&quot;&#10;&#10;On May 8, 2007, a posthumous two-disc compilation album entitled New Moon was released by Kill Rock Stars. The album contained 24 songs recorded by Smith between 1994 and 1997 during his tenure with the label. The songs consisted of demos, early versions, previously released b-sides and some unfinished tracks. In the U.S., the album debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week. The record received favorable reviews and was Metacritic&apos;s 16th best-reviewed album of 2007. A significant portion of the proceeds from album sales are to go to Outside In, a social service agency for low-income adults and homeless youth in Portland, Oregon.&#10;&#10;On October 25, 2007, a book titled Elliott Smith was released by Autumn de Wilde, which consists of photographs, handwritten lyrics and &quot;revealing talks with Smith&apos;s inner circle&quot;. De Wilde was responsible for the Figure 8 sleeve art, making a landmark and de facto Smith memorial of the Solutions Audio mural. A five-song CD featuring previously unreleased live recordings of Smith performing acoustically at Club Largo in Los Angeles was included in the release.&#10;&#10;Musical style and influences&#10;&#10;Smith respected and was inspired by many artists and styles, including U2, The Kinks, Elvis Costello, Motown and flamenco records, AC/DC, Scorpions, and Modest Mouse. Smith claimed to listen exclusively to select albums (such as The Marble Index by Nico) for months. Sean Croghan (a former roommate of Smith&apos;s and member of bands Jr. High and Crackerbash) said that Smith &quot;listened almost exclusively to slow jams&quot; in his senior year at college. Smith was also known to gain inspiration from novels, religion and philosophy. He liked classic literature, especially Samuel Beckett, T. S. Eliot, and Fyodor Dostoevsky (and other Russian novelists).&#10;&#10;Smith mentioned his admiration for Bob Dylan in several interviews, citing him as an early musical influence. He once commented: &quot;My father taught me how to play &quot;Don&apos;t Think Twice, It&apos;s All Right&quot;. I love Dylan&apos;s words, but even more than that, I love the fact that he loves words.&quot; Smith covered Dylan&apos;s &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot; several times in concert.&#10;&#10;Smith was a dedicated fan of The Beatles (as well as their solo projects), once noting that he had been listening to them frequently since he was about &quot;four years old&quot; and also claimed that hearing The White Album was his original inspiration to become a musician. In 1998, Smith recorded and contributed a cover of the Beatles song &quot;Because&quot; to the American Beauty soundtrack, which can be heard during the closing credits of the film. Although this was the only Beatles song that Smith ever officially released, he is known to have recorded at least one other (&quot;Revolution (Beatles Cover)&quot;, during the sessions for XO), and played many songs by both the band and the members&apos; solo projects at live concerts. &#10;&#10;Regarding his songwriting, Smith said: “The way I think about it is... I don&apos;t really think about it in terms of language, I think about it more like shapes. That&apos;s an interesting thing to talk about but it&apos;s difficult. I&apos;m really into chord changes. That was the thing that I liked when I was a kid. So, I&apos;m not like a... I don&apos;t make up &apos;a riff&apos; really. It&apos;s usually like... that sequence that has some implied melody in it or something like that.” Smith said that transitions were his favorite part of songs and that he preferred to write broader, more impressionistic music closer to pop rather than folk music. Smith compared his songs to stories or dreams, not purely confessional pieces that people could relate to. When asked about the dark nature of his songwriting and the cult following he was gaining, Smith said he felt it was merely a product of him writing songs that were strongly meaningful to him rather than anything contrived. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Elliott+Smith&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content> Malcolm John &quot;Mac&quot; Rebennack, Jr. (born November 21, 1940), better known by the stage name Dr. John (also Dr. John Creaux), is an American singer-songwriter, pianist and guitarist whose music combines blues, boogie woogie and rock and roll.  The winner of five Grammy awards, Rebennack was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by singer John Legend on Monday, March 14, 2011.&#10;&#10;Dr. John has been making his own idiosyncratic music since the 1960s. Along with Professor Longhair, Dr. John is heir to the rich New Orleans tradition. He is perhaps best known for &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot;, an international hit in 1973, reissued and used on soundtracks many times since.&#10;&#10;Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, his professional musical career began as a session musician in New Orleans in the 1950s. Early on he also played guitar and was often known as Mac Rebennack. He switched to the bass (&quot;the lowest time of my life&quot;), and then the piano after his index finger was nearly shot off protecting his bandmate and longtime friend Ronnie Barron. He gained fame beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with music that combined New Orleans-style rhythm and blues with psychedelic rock and stage shows that bordered on voodoo religious ceremonies, including elaborate costumes and headdress. For a time he was billed as Doctor John, The Night Tripper. The name &quot;Dr. John&quot; came from a legendary Louisiana voodoo practitioner from the start of the 19th century.&#10;&#10;Dr. John has also done vocals for Popeyes Chicken &amp; Biscuits&apos; &quot;Luv dat chicken...&quot; jingle, as well as the theme song (&quot;My Opinionation&quot;) for the early-1990s television sitcom Blossom. His movie credits include Martin Scorsese&apos;s documentary The Last Waltz (in which he joins The Band for a performance of his song &quot;Such a Night&quot;) and Blues Brothers 2000 (in which he joins the fictional band The Louisiana Gator Boys to perform the song &quot;New Orleans&quot;).  In the 2009 Disney film The Princess and the Frog, Dr. John sings the opening tune, &quot;Down in New Orleans&quot;.&#10;&#10;In January 2008 Mac Rebennack, Dr. John, was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame.&#10;&#10;&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+John&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

Their first few releases appeared on the Catalogue imprint and were lapped up by those seeking a way to wind down after a night of furious funking to the likes of Pepe Bradock and Daft Punk. &quot;Mundo&quot; has been licensed from Catalogue for the Wagram Music double CD, Paris Lounge. It sits comfortably (on a chaise longue) next to cuts from Llorca, Le Tone, Kojak, and Next Evidence. Tim &apos;Love&apos; Lee fans will be impressed by the way Sporto Kantes combine Latin and Afro-Cuban influences with modern breakbeat technology. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sporto+Kantes&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>There are 3 bands with the name Simon Says.  One is a hard rock band from California, and the other is a prog rock band from Sweden. Simon Says is also a band from Estonia, Narva. They&apos;re a metalcore band with nu metal influences.&#10;&#10;Simon Says (U.S.):&#10;Simon Says was formed by a group of California high schoolers (Matt Franks, Zac Diebels, and Mike Johnston) who got their start playing high school auditoriums around the state in the early 1990s. Adding bassist Mike Arrieta in 1995, the group self-released two records, which attracted the attention of manager Jeff Saltzman. Saltzman set them up with Cake&apos;s producer Mark Needham and got them signed to Hollywood Records in July 1998. In 1999, they released their major-label debut, Jump Start, which yielded two hit modern rock singles, and the follow-up Shut Your Breath added a third radio hit.&#10;&#10;In 2001, Simon Says left Hollywood Records over promotional issues and changed their name to Key to Arson; soon after, drummer Mike Johnston left the band, to be replaced by Dave &quot;Stixx&quot; Marich. In 2004, Key to Arson announced the completion of an album entitled Light &apos;Em Up, but by the end of the year the band had broken up.&#10;&#10;Simon Says (Sweden):&#10;Stockholm in the early 90&apos;s was throbbing with prog. Numerous bands played small clubs and pubs in Sweden&apos;s capital. Most attention was paid to Anekdoten, Änglagaard and Landberk. &#10;&#10;On the fringes of this underground movement there was a less known band called Egg. An unorthodox band: while sounding as harsh and brutal as both VdGG and Crimson, they still struggled to make their melodies as catchy as those of pop tune. &#10;&#10;Bass player of Egg at the time was Stefan Renström, who upon joining them immediately had sensed the band&apos;s potential. But when Stefan wanted to lead the band in a certain direction, a lot of friction surfaced. Furthermore, his personal life collapsed and Stefan, unhappily, left both the band and Stockholm to form a new outfit. &#10;&#10;Around Christmas &apos;93 he made contact with a then very young Daniel Fäldt, singer of experimental band Leifs Hyvel. Things were settled: Simon Says was to be a project with the two of them as the nucleus. &#10;&#10;In March &apos;94 Stefan and producer Kenneth Magnusson started planning Simon Says&apos; first album. In August 1995 Ceinwen was released, to mostly positive reviews. A live act was put together and Simon Says looked like they were growing into a band. After a few gigs, however, the project was put on ice Stefan wasn&apos;t happy with the way Simon Says sounded and when both he and Daniel moved they suddenly were too far away from each other to be able to continue anyhow. Daniel started studying philosophy, then drifted off to India and the Middle East for two long periods. Meanwhile, Stefan focused on his role as bass player in his other band, Wagnerian space rockers The Moor, with whom he cut Flux in 1996. &#10;&#10;So, while Daniel was studying sitar in India, Stefan and The Moor toured Europe with legendary singer/flute and sax player Nik Turner of Hawkwind. Then, in 2001, Stefan felt he had somehow written a new Simon Says album. Guitarist Jonas Hallberg, Stefan&apos;s stand-in on bass in The Moor, was recruited, as well as Mattias Jarlhed (from Valinor&apos;s Tree) who recorded the drum parts only four days after having been invited to join. &#10;&#10;After four weeks Paradise Square was finished and a deal with Galileo records was struck. The album was released in July 2002 and was met by everything between very good and rave reviews. But after eight months of sporadic rehearsals the band was shelved. Again. &#10;&#10;Stefan refused to give Simon Says up, though. In spite of a series of domestic problems culminating in a tragic divorce he dedicated every spare second to write and record new music. And so, the band has in the last years contributed to a series of Musea samplers while all the time working on the main project: the one about survival. Tardigrade. &#10;&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Says&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<summary>The Limp Twins are Will Holland (a.k.a quantic) and Russell Porter, who created their album tales from beyond the groove (TRUCD057, 2003) in their bedrooms (according to the cd cover). The record is a funky offering somewhere in between the sound of Will Holland&apos;s other projects, quantic and the quantic soul orchestra, but is definately more laid back. &#10;&#10;For more information on this project, check out quantic&apos;s website: about The Limp Twins. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/The+Limp+Twins&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

The record features guest appearances from Sylvian as well as Juice Aleem and encompasses elements of dark downtempo, quirky house, and minimal techno.&#10;&#10;Babilonia followed on London label Peacefrog in 2005, and added baroque pop and folk stylings. Vocal contributions come from Feist, Sylvian, and Yael Naïm. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Readymade+FC&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Curtis Ousley (February 7, 1934 – August 13, 1971), who performed under the stage name King Curtis, was an American saxophone virtuoso known for rhythm and blues, rock and roll, soul, blues, funk and soul jazz. Variously a bandleader, band member, and session musician, he was also a musical director and record producer. Adept at tenor, alto, and soprano saxophone, he was best known for his distinctive riffs and solos such as on The Coasters - Yakety Yak, which later became the inspiration for Boots Randolph&apos;s &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; and his own &quot;Memphis Soul Stew&quot;.&#10;&#10;Curtis Ousley was adopted, with his sister, Josephine Ousley Allen. They were raised together in Fort Worth, Texas. Ousley attended I.M. Terrell High School, and studied and performed music with schoolmate Ornette Coleman.&#10;&#10;Ousley started playing saxophone at the age of twelve in the Fort Worth area. He took interest in many musical genres including jazz, rhythm and blues, and popular music. As a student pursuing music, he turned down college scholarships in order to join the Lionel Hampton Band. During his time with Hampton, he was able to write and arrange music and learn guitar. In 1952 Curtis decided to move to New York and became a session musician, recording for such labels as Prestige, Enjoy, Capitol, and Atco. He recorded with Nat Adderley, Wynton Kelly, Buddy Holly, Waylon Jennings and Andy Williams.&#10;&#10;Stylistically, Curtis took inspiration from saxophonists Lester Young, Louis Jordan, Illinois Jacquet, Earl Bostic, and Gene Ammons. Known for his syncopated and percussive style, he was both versatile and powerful as a musician. He put together a group during his time as a session musician that included Richard Tee, Cornell Dupree, Jerry Jemmott, and Bernard Purdie.&#10;&#10;King Curtis enjoyed playing jazz and rhythm &amp; blues but decided he would make more money as a rhythm &amp; blues musician, stating in a 1971 interview with Charlie Gillet that &quot;I love the authentic rhythm &amp; blues more than anything, and I also like to live well.&quot; From the 1950s until the mid-1960s, he worked as a session player, recording under his own name and with others such as the Coasters, with whom he recorded &quot;Yakety Yak.&quot; Buddy Holly hired him for session work, during which they recorded &quot;Reminiscing.&quot; Holly wrote this song, but gave Curtis the songwriting credit for flying down to the session. His best-known singles from this period are &quot;Soul Twist&quot; and &quot;Soul Serenade.&quot; He provided backing on a number of songs for LaVern Baker, including her 1958 hit single &quot;I Cried a Tear&quot;, where his saxophone became &quot;a second voice&quot;.&#10;&#10;In 1965, he moved to Atlantic Records and recorded his most successful singles, &quot;Memphis Soul Stew&quot; and &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; (1967). He worked with The Coasters, led Aretha Franklin&apos;s backing band The Kingpins. The Kingpins opened for The Beatles during their 1965 performance at Shea Stadium. Curtis produced records, often working with Jerry Wexler and recorded for Groove Records during this period, including the Joe South song &quot;Games People Play&quot; with guitarist Duane Allman.&#10;&#10;In March 1971 he appeared with Aretha Franklin and The Kingpins at the Fillmore West, which resulted in two live albums: Aretha Live at Fillmore West, and Curtis&apos; own Live at Fillmore West. In July 1971, Curtis recorded saxophone solos on &quot;It&apos;s So Hard&quot; and &quot;I Don&apos;t Wanna Be a Soldier&quot; from John Lennon&apos;s Imagine. Along with The Rimshots, he recorded the original theme song for the 1971 hit television show, Soul Train, titled &quot;Hot Potatoes.&quot;&#10;&#10;Curtis was killed on August 13, 1971 when he was stabbed during an argument with a pair of drug dealers he discovered on the steps outside his Manhattan apartment. Curtis was attempting to carry an air conditioner into his apartment when Juan Montanez refused to move from the entrance. A fight ensued and Montanez stabbed Curtis. Curtis later died at Roosevelt Hospital. In March 1972, Montanez was sentenced to seven years for second-degree manslaughter, but was released in late 1977 for good behavior.&#10;&#10;On the day of Curtis&apos; funeral Atlantic Records closed their offices. Jesse Jackson administered the service and as the mourners filed in, Curtis&apos; band &apos;The Kingpins&apos; played &quot;Soul Serenade&quot;. Among those attending were Ousley&apos;s immediate family, including sister Josephine Ousley Allen, other family members, Aretha Franklin, Cissy Houston, Brook Benton and Duane Allman. Franklin sang the closing spiritual &quot;Never Grow Old&quot; and Stevie Wonder performed &quot;Abraham, Martin and John and now King Curtis&quot;.&#10;&#10;Curtis was subsequently buried in a red granite-fronted wall crypt in the &apos;West Gallery of Forsythia Court&apos; mausoleum at Pinelawn Memorial Park in Farmingdale, New York, the same cemetery that holds jazz greats Count Basie and John Coltrane.&#10;&#10;In 1970, a year before his death, Curtis won the Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance Grammy for &quot;Games People Play&quot;.&#10;&#10;Curtis was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 6, 2000.&#10;&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/King+Curtis&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>The Quantic Soul Orchestra is a live funk project initiated by Will Holland, aka Quantic, which eschews the use of samples in favour of a rawer &apos;70s sound. Considered one of the main acts in the modern funk movement.&#10;&#10;Releases&#10;- Stampede (2003)&#10;- Pushin&apos; On (2005)&#10;- I&apos;m Thankful (2006)&#10;- Tropidélico (2007)&#10;&#10;&quot;Putting something back&quot; is how Will Holland described the reason for starting The Quantic Soul Orchestra. Having released two succesful albums on Tru Thoughts under his Quantic guise - The 5th Exotic and Apricot Morning (which fused jazzy and breakbeat sounds), he felt his next musical adventure would be to focus on the album Stampede. The Quantic Soul Orchestra is a live project, strictly no samples allowed. Influenced by Mr Holland&apos;s love of the dusty funk 45&apos;s, he wanted to record and produce an album with creative and like minded musicians.&#10;&#10;With pop acts in the 2000s now using hip-hop beats (beats which are heavily influenced by funk records from the 70s) it was important for the QSO to make their sound rough, raw and real - it&apos;s definitely not Acid Jazz but has a deeper funk sound that shows that this music is well and truly alive in the new millennium. Their album Stampede was influenced by the many flamboyant (but often poor) musicians in the 70s who loved music for music&apos;s sake, who wanted to dance and make people dance.&#10;&#10;They are not trying to be retro and trendy, hence the cover version of 4 Hero&apos;s future soul anthem from 2002 Hold It Down. Sung in one take as vocalist Alice Russell warmed up before a recording session, it was decided that the original Holland penned instrumental should be replaced with this version. Ms Russell also lends her soulful voice to two other tracks on Stampede Something That&apos;s Real and Take Your Time, Change Your Mind. The other sung track finds John Hughes adding vocals (as well as some guitar and flute) to the classic QSO 7&quot; Super 8. The QSO also adds Afro Beat, Soul and Jazz influences to the Funk sound with musicians Dave Woodhouse (Clavinet, Rhodes and Trumpet), Damian Bell (Trombone), Antonia Pheulatos (String Arrangements and Violin), Lucy Holland (Saxophone), Richard Gibbs (Drums) and of course Will Holland himself (Guitars, Bass and Percussion) adding to the variety.&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/The+Quantic+Soul+Orchestra&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Anthony B is the stage name of Keith Blair (born March 31, 1976), a Jamaican musician.&#10;&#10;Blair grew up in rural Clarks Town in the northwestern parish of Trelawny. His deeply religious family life (his mother was a Seventh-day Adventist and his grandmother a Revivalist) imbued him with a profound spirituality. During his youth, his favorite singers were reggae legends Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer, musicians who strongly influenced his own style. Peter Tosh&apos;s influence can definitely be heard in Anthony B&apos;s vocal delivery and revolutionary stance.&#10;&#10;Anthony B adopted Rastafarian beliefs as a teenager, a decision which was not well-received by his family. The stubborn and determined Anthony B refused to give up his new religion and his dreadlocks and moved to the home of his aunt and uncle in the Kingston suburb, Portmore.&#10;&#10;While attending high school, Anthony B debuted as a deejay for the local sound system, Shaggy Hi-Power. In 1988, he befriended reggae artists such as Determine, Mega Banton, Ricky General and Terror Fabulous.&#10;&#10;At this point in the reggae industry, singing &quot;slack&quot; songs about women was the popular thing to do. Anthony B did not believe in degrading women and chose to pen politically-slanted songs rather than so-called &quot;gyal chunes.&quot; He hooked up with Little Devon the Half Pint sound-a-like singer he made his debut single &quot;The Living is Hard&quot; on the Wizard label in 1993. Anthony B tried many different producers but found that none of them fit his style of music. Finally, Anthony B teamed up with Richard &quot;Bello&quot; Bell, creating hits such as Fire Pon Rome, Raid Di Barn, Rumour, and Repentance Time. Anthony B&apos;s 1996 debut album Real Revolutionary was highly acclaimed in the reggae community. In late 1997, Anthony B released Universal Struggle which showed that Anthony B had a consistent, high-calibre talent. Anthony B has released a large number of albums since that time including 1999&apos;s Seven Seals and 2004&apos;s Untouchable which featured collaborations with artists including Wyclef Jean.&#10;&#10;Anthony B tours extensively in Europe and North America and is known for his fiery, high-energy performances.&#10;&#10;Anthony B is a member of the Bobo Ashanti branch of the Rastafarian movement. &quot;Bobo Dreads&quot;, as they are known, are recognizable by their long robes and turbans. The strong Afrocentric pride and the other Rastafarian beliefs (or &quot;overstandings&quot; as Rastafarians prefer to call them) which Anthony B holds are reflected in his songs.&#10;&#10;Discography&#10;&#10;    * Predator &amp; Prey (1996, Alpha Enterprises)&#10;    * Real Revolutionary / So Many Things (1996, Greensleeves)&#10;    * Universal Struggle (1997, VP Records)&#10;    * Seven Seals (1999, VP Records)&#10;    * That&apos;s Life (2001, VP Records)&#10;    * More Love (2001, AO !

<content>There are at least two artists that have used this name:&#10;1. A roots reggae band from Jamaica&#10;2. A straight edge metalcore band from Florida, US&#10;&#10;1. Culture was a Jamaican roots reggae group founded in 1976. Originally they were known as the African Disciples.&#10;&#10;The members of the trio were Joseph Hill (lead vocals), Albert Walker (backing vocals) and Kenneth Dayes (backing vocals).&#10;&#10;Shortly after Culture came together, they began working with the &quot;Mighty Two&quot; – producer Joe Gibbs and engineer Errol Thompson. While at Gibbs’ studio, they recorded a series of powerful singles, many of which ended up on their debut album ‘Two Sevens Clash’. After their success with Gibbs, the group went on to make a string of albums for producer Sonia Pottinger. Culture began working with some of the premier musicians of the day including Robbie Shakespeare, Sly Dunbar, Ansel Collins, Cedric Brooks and the ever-present percussionist Sticky. Virgin Records picked up the albums, and that added distribution enabled Culture to gain an even larger following outside of Jamaica.&#10;&#10;Critically considered one of the most authentic traditional reggae acts, at the time of the first Rolling Stone Record Guide publication, they were the only band of any genre whose every recording received a five-star review (of bands with more than one recording in the guide).&#10;&#10;In 1982 the three singers went their own ways. Hill carried on using the Culture name, and recorded the Lion Rock album, which was released in the United States by Heartbeat Records. For their part, Walker and Dayes recorded a handful of songs on their own – a few of which turned up on an album titled Roots &amp; Culture. In 1986 the original line-up reformed to record two highly regarded albums – Culture in Culture and Culture at Work. These releases marked the beginning of a very busy period for the group, including annual albums and countless tours. The U.S. label Shanachie released a steady stream of new and old Culture albums up to Wings Of A Dove in 1992.&#10;&#10;Joseph Hill, who came to symbolize the face of Culture, died in Germany on 19 August 2006 while the group was on tour. His son, Kenyatta Hill, now is the lead singer.&#10;&#10;2) Classic mid/late 90s hardcore from Florida, celebrated for, among a handful of others, helping to cultivate the burgeoning metallic hardcore sound that became synonymous with the era.&#10;&#10;CULTURE was known for aggressive social/political/ecological commentary, cautionary tales of reckless consumerism and industrial sprawl, and advocacy of the straightedge lifestyle.&#10;&#10;Former members went on to Morning Again, Terror, As Friends Rust, Shai Hulud, Throwdown, Blood Has Been Shed and (most recently) ON BODIES.&#10;&#10;In 2012, CULTURE played its first show since disbanding in 1998 (The Reel &amp; Restless Fest in Miami, Florida). This fall, in August of 2013, the band will revisit Europe for Belgium&apos;s famed Ieper Hardcore Festival, and will then play three dates in Japan, including Tokyo&apos;s Bloodaxe Fest.&#10;&#10;Members included:&#10;&#10;Rich Thurston (Guitar: 1993-1997, Bass: 1993, Vocals: 1993, Drums: 1996)&#10;Josh Williams (Drums: 1993-1997)&#10;Stan Obal (Bass: 1993)&#10;Mark Mitchell (Vocals: 1993, Vocals: 1996)&#10;Pete Carreno (Bass: 1994)&#10;John Wylie (Guitar: 1994-1995)&#10;Damien Moyal (Vocals: 1994-1995, Vocals: 1997-1998)&#10;Gordon Tarpley (Bass: 1995-1997, Guitar: 1998)&#10;Louie Long (Vocals: 1995)&#10;Anthony Conte (Vocals: 1995)&#10;Steve Looker (Guitar: 1996-1997)&#10;Jason Dooley (Drums: 1997)&#10;Timothy Kirkpatrick (Drums: 1997-1998)&#10;Joe Simmons (Guitar:1997-1998)&#10;Floyd Beckham (Bass: 1998)&#10;Kenneth Brian (Guitar: 1998)&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Culture&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Naggo Morris&#10;Biography&#10;&#10;Naggo Morris, given name Dolphin George Morris.Born of Vernal Naggo Morris and Ivy Morris on September 30, 1947, in Carron Hall, St. Mary.  Moved to Kingston at two weeks old. Lived at Chisholm Ave for all his childhood years and into adulthood.  He is proud to mention that he attended Miss Allen’s school then Rousssea school at Ricketts Ave, Kingston 13.&#10;His dad was an avid musician/entertainer who at times made folks cried when he played his saxophone, so he fell in love with the entertainment business from observing him. He started out as a dancer with a group called the Coaster with Coupland Forbes, and Lenord Mundy. They worked with Luis Bennett and Ranny Williams on TV shows such as Sounds of the Seventies, Mambo Tam Boo, Ring Ding and Coozie Corner. They also did Christmas Morning shows at Carib Theatre, Regal Magestic Theatre and State Theatre in Kingston, Strand and Palladium Theatre  in Montego Bay. Fine start to life in the entertainment business especially working with the great Luis Bennett.&#10;Dancing was not enough for the multi talented Naggo Morris. He moved on to join a singing group called the Morwells,  then moved to the Royals with whom they did albums such as,  Pick up the Peices, and Conference Table. I also did some harmony for studio 1 recording studio with a group called the Soul Boys (Barrington Spence and Junior Zun).  They did a few songs for down beat/ studio one then moved to Treasure Isle recording studio where we worked along side Stranger Cole, Alton Ellis,  Slim Smith,  The Technique, The Unique and others.  He then went on to doing  a single called Say You (Adapted) for Prince Toney on the front line recording label. He also did vocals on an album called Rasta Ambassador with U-Roy who DJ. &#10; Some of his major hits were Here I Come with Clappas Record, the renowned Su Su Pan Rasta and Jah guide with Joe Gibbs and of course these were all number one hits on the charts. The riddim for Su Su Pan Rasta was so huge that Prince Far I did a song called Heavy Manner’s on it and which was a big hit too  He also did One Meal on the Joe Gibbs Label. During this time he  did backing vocals with Lloyd Parks of We the people band and Rudy Thomas May his soul rest in Peace.  Some of his most treasured moments were working alongside Dennis Brown,  Gregory Isaacs and Bob Andy with whom they produce multiple hit songs.&#10;In 1974 he did the hit song Flour Power which was inspired by cases of people being poisoned by flour contaminated with rat poison in Jamaica. This took the entertainment industry by storm and continues to be a well loved song.&#10;Being the very accomplished roots singer he was it wasno mistake when the Heptones recruited him to replace Leroy Sibbles after he migrated in 1975. His deep roots style perfectly complimented the Heptones (Earl Morgan, Barry Llewellyn) keen harmony As lead singer for the Heptones they were the first to grace the stages of  the first Reggae Sun Splash that came to Jarrett Park Montego bay. It was a real honor for him to be apart of such a momentous  event in the history of Jamaican reggae music. They opened the show billed with top artist such as Bob Marley, Ken Booth Alton Ellis and many others. It was the first performance but not the last. They also performed  in the 1982 at the Catherine Hall Bob Marley Center. &#10;The Heptones recorded a song for Channel one called, “How Could I Leave,” and others but Paulie(owner of channel) died and those songs weren’t released but played on dub plate.  Dennis Brown re-recorded the same song How Could I Leave on the Joe Gibbs label and it became number one.  Despite this the Heptones kept going. They  did an album  called , “Better Days” for Winston Niney Holliness  Boswell  then they went to England on tour in 1975. The Heptones toured Europe, Canada and the USA. One of Naggo’s  most treasured memory is visiting Scotland and seeing men wearing skirts with their bag pipes a big cultural difference.    &#10;He has worked with musicians such as Ansell Collins (key boards), Lloyd Park(Bass), Robbie Shaekespear(Bass), Sly Dunbar(drums), Frankie Bubbler (Organ), Ranchie McLean (guitarist), Ricka Backa (guitarist), Bongo Herman (percussion), Frank Aird aka Blazing Frank (trumpet), Vin Gordon (trombone), Deadly Headley( alto horns), &#10;My new album Everyday Life a Morris Must production will be out soon. Songs written by him, but four in combination with Vivia Morris, backing vocals Earl Morgan, Barringtong Llewellyn and Naggo lead vocalist. The album was arranged by The Heptones, Vivia Morris, Errol Morris and Mitchell Morris.&#10;He gives thanks to  Winston Holliness and Larry MacDonald  for producing most of his music.  Thanks to Earl Morgan and Barry Llewellyn for the opportunity to work with them . A special thank you to Roy Francis from the mixing lab studios.&#10;Naggo Morris continues to perform with the Heptones and to do solo acts. He is now making preparations for shows in Canada, USA, Europe and Brazil.&#10;&#10;For Booking and Reservations:&#10;Contact: Vivia Morris&#10; Manager:&#10;Telephone: 1-763-568-6067.&#10;E-Mail: viviamanda@hotmail.com&#10;Skype: vivia.morris&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Naggo+Morris&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>With the tragic murder of Hugh Mundell, who was shot and killed while sitting in a car with Junior Reid, reggae lost one of its most promising young performers. Mundell&apos;s 1978 debut album, Africa Must Be Free By 1983, produced by Augustus Pablo, in Jamaica remains a classic roots reggae recording. Mundell&apos;s singing style and soothing voice will lull you into tranquility if you let it. &#10;&#10;Mundell, the son of a prominent Jamaican lawyer, was still a teenager when he teamed with influential producer Joe Gibbs to record a still-unreleased single, &quot;&apos;Where Is Natty Dread.&quot; His first break came when he was hired as a DJ for Augustus Pablo&apos;s Rockers sound system. His debut single, &quot;Africa Must Be Free by 1983&quot;, produced by Augustus Pablo, was released in early 1978. Mundell also recorded several 12&quot; singles as Jah Levi. &#10;&#10;Mundell continued recording with Pablo. The albums Time &amp; Place and Blackman&apos;s Foundation followed shortly after, and then a few tracks for Prince Jammy were gathered together along with some of Lacksley Castell&apos;s, put on an album and called Jah Fire. &#10;&#10;Beginning in 1979, Mundell took over the production of his own recordings. He released his Mundell album on Greensleeves in 1982. He also produced the debut album, Speak the Truth, by &quot;Little&quot; Junior Reid, on Pablo&apos;s label, Rockers. &#10;&#10;In 1983 he became involved in an argument and was shot in the neck. Shortly afterwards, his posthumous album Arise was released. A dub version of Africa Must Be Free By 1983 was released in 1989 and then packaged with the original by Greensleeves and RAS, and then Makasound packaged Time &amp; Place and Blackman&apos;s Foundation together and released it as The Blessed Youth in 2003. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Hugh+Mundell&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Jamaican ska vocal group The Maytals became a reggae band 1971, renamed Toots and The Maytals with Frederick &quot;Toots&quot; Hibbert as front figure. The band got a Grammy award 2005 for the album True Love. Funky Kingston in early 70s is on Rolling Stone&apos;s list The Greatest Albums of All Time. Bass line in &apos;54-46 That&apos;s My Number&apos; is one of the most covered in pop music. &apos;Monkey Man&apos;, &apos;Pressure Drop&apos;, &apos;Bam Bam&apos;, etc, made them to favorites for the early skinhead movement of white working-class youth in UK.  &#10;- - -&#10;&#10;Toots and The Maytals  are from Kingston, Jamaica. It was the producer Byron Lee who 1971 renamed them Toots &amp; the Maytals. Frederick &quot;Toots&quot; Hibbert, the leader of the group and the lead singer, was born in May Pen in the Parish of Clarendon, Jamaica. He was the youngest of seven children. He grew up singing gospel music in a church choir, but moved to Kingston in 1961 at the age of sixteen.&#10;&#10;In Kingston, he met Henry &quot;Raleigh&quot; Gordon and Nathaniel &quot;Jerry&quot; McCarthy, forming a group whose early recordings were attributed to &quot;The Flames&quot; and, possibly, &quot;The Vikings&quot;. Having renamed the group the Maytals, the vocal trio recorded their first album, &quot;Never Grow Old - presenting the Maytals&quot;, for producer Clement &quot;Coxsone&quot; Dodd at Studio One in 1962-63. With musical backing from Dodd&apos;s house band, the legendary Skatalites, the Maytals&apos; close-harmony gospel singing ensured instant success for the 1964 release, overshadowing Dodd&apos;s other up-and-coming gospel trio, The Wailers. The original album augmented by studio out-takes from the Studio One sessions was re-released by Heartbeat/Rounder Records in 1997, and is essential listening for Maytals and Skatalites fans.&#10;&#10;After staying at Studio One for about two years, the group moved on to do sessions for Prince Buster (released in 1974) before recording their second album produced by Byron Lee in 1965. However, the band&apos;s musical career was rudely interrupted in late 1966 when Hibbert was arrested and imprisoned on drug possession charges.&#10;&#10;Following Hibbert&apos;s release from jail towards the end of 1967, the band officially changed their name to Toots and the Maytals and began working with Chinese-Jamaican producer Leslie Kong, a collaboration which produced three classic albums and a string of hits throughout the late sixties and early seventies - &quot;Do the Reggay&quot;, a 1968 single widely credited with coining the word reggae, &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, &quot;54-46 was my number&quot; and &quot;Monkey Man&quot;, the group&apos;s first international hit in 1970. The group was featured in one of reggae&apos;s greatest breakthrough events - The Harder They Come, the 1972 film and soundtrack starring Jimmy Cliff.&#10;&#10;Following Kong&apos;s death in 1971, the group continued to record with Kong&apos;s former sound engineer, Warwick Lyn; produced by Lyn and Chris Blackwell of Island Records, the group released three best-selling albums, and enjoyed international hits with &quot;Funky Kingston&quot; in 1973 and &quot;Reggae Got Soul&quot; in 1976.&#10;&#10;Toots and the Maytals&apos; compositions would be given a second airing in 1978-80 during the reggae-punk and ska revival period in the UK, when the Specials included &quot;Monkey Man&quot; on their 1979 debut album and the Clash produced their version of &quot;Pressure Drop&quot;, with other Maytals&apos; covers being recorded by Sublime. Having toured throughout the world for many years, Toots and the Maytals disbanded in the early 1980s, but reformed in the early 90s to continue touring and recording successfully.&#10;&#10;The band recently won the 2005 Grammy award for reggae for the album True Love, an album consisting of re-recorded versions of their classics alongside popular and legendary musicians such as Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, and Keith Richards, as well as popular artists today such as No Doubt, Ben Harper, The Roots, and Shaggy.&#10;&#10;They also contributed to the Easy Star All-Stars album &apos;Radiodread&apos; (a dub tribute to Radiohead&apos;s OK Computer). &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Toots+and+The+Maytals&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

August 29, 1968) is a singer, bassist, and multi-instrumentalist. She was born Michelle Johnson to Army lieutenant (and saxophonist) father Jacques Johnson and her mother, Helen in Berlin, Germany.&#10;&#10;Raised in Washington, D.C., Meshell Suihailia Bashir Shakur (as she became known) adopted the surname Ndegeocello, which means &quot;free like a bird&quot;, while still in her teens.

She has frequently toured with Lilith Fair.&#10;&#10;Ndegeocello honed her chops on the D.C. Go go circuit in the late 1980s before venturing out as a solo artist. She emerged as a recording artist in 1993 on Maverick Records/Sire Records with her debut, Plantation Lullabies. This recording presented a distinctly androgynous persona. Her music has been featured in a number of film soundtracks including How Stella Got Her Groove Back and Batman and Robin. She has also appeared on recordings by Basement Jaxx and The Blind Boys of Alabama, among others. Her biggest hit is a duet with John Cougar Mellencamp, a cover version of Van Morrison&apos;s &quot;Wild Night&quot;, which reached #3 on the Billboard charts.&#10;&#10;Her singles &quot;If That&apos;s Your Boyfriend (He Wasn&apos;t Last Night)&quot;, &quot;Leviticus: Faggot&quot;, and her cover of Bill Withers &quot;Who Is He and What Is He To You?&quot; have all charted in the Billboard top 20. She sang background vocals on the song &quot;I&apos;d Rather be Your Lover&quot; by Madonna, on her album &quot;Bedtime Stories.&quot;. She also sang with Chaka Khan on the single &quot;Never Miss the Water&quot;, as well as providing her typical solid bass skills.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Meshell+Ndegeocello&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Steven Paul &quot;Elliott&quot; Smith (August 6, 1969 – October 21, 2003) was an American songwriter and musician. Smith was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and resided for a significant portion of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he first gained popularity. His primary instrument was the guitar, but he was also proficient at piano, clarinet, bass, drums and harmonica. Smith had a distinctive vocal style characterized by his &quot;whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery&quot; and use of multi-tracking to create vocal harmonies.&#10;&#10;After playing in the rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994 with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars. In 1997 he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, included in the soundtrack for the film Good Will Hunting, was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category in 1997.&#10;&#10;Smith battled with depression, alcoholism and drug addiction for years, and these topics often appeared in his lyrics. At age 34, he died in Los Angeles, California from two stab wounds to the chest. The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, From a Basement on the Hill, which was released posthumously on October 19, 2004.&#10;&#10;Early life&#10;&#10;Steven Paul Smith was born at Clarkson Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska. His mother, Bunny Welch (née Bunny Kay Berryman), was a music teacher at an elementary school, and his father, Gary Smith, was a University of Nebraska medical student at the time. His parents divorced about a year later, and Smith moved with his mother to live in Duncanville, Texas. Much later in his life, Smith got a tattoo of a map of Texas on his upper arm and said, &quot;I didn&apos;t get it because I like Texas, kinda the opposite. But I won&apos;t forget about it although I&apos;m tempted to &apos;cause I don&apos;t like it there.&quot; Smith endured a difficult childhood and a troubled relationship with his stepfather Charlie. Smith reflected the impact of this part of his life in the lyrics of &quot;Some Song&quot;: &quot;Charlie beat you up week after week, and when you grow up you&apos;re going to be a freak.&quot; The name &quot;Charlie&quot; also appeared in the lyrics for &quot;Flowers for Charlie&quot; and &quot;No Confidence Man&quot;. The family was a part of the Community of Christ through much of Smith&apos;s childhood, but eventually began attending services at a local Methodist Church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him &quot;really scared of hell&quot;. In a 2001 interview, he stated, &quot;I don&apos;t necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But I have my own version of it&quot;. At the age of nine, Smith began playing the piano, and at ten began learning guitar on a small acoustic guitar bought for him by his father. At this age he also composed an original piano piece, &quot;Fantasy,&quot; which won him a prize at an arts festival. Many of the people on his mother&apos;s side of the family were non-professional musicians; his grandfather was a Dixieland drummer and his grandmother sang in a glee club.&#10;&#10;At 14, Smith moved from Texas to Portland, Oregon, to live with his father, who was then working as a psychiatrist. It was around this time that Smith first began trying drugs and alcohol with friends as well as experimenting with recording for the first time, borrowing a four-track recorder. During high school, Smith played clarinet in the school band and also played guitar, piano and sang in the bands Stranger Than Fiction, A Murder of Crows and The Greenhouse, billed as either Steven Smith or &quot;Johnny Panic&quot;. He graduated from Lincoln High School as a National Merit Scholar.&#10;&#10;After graduation, Steven Smith began calling himself &quot;Elliott&quot;, saying that he thought &quot;Steve&quot; sounded too much like a &quot;jock&quot; name, and that &quot;Steven&quot; sounded &quot;too bookish&quot;. Biographer S. R. Shutt speculates that it was either inspired by Elliott Avenue, a street that Smith had lived on in Portland, or that it was suggested by his then-girlfriend. A junior high acquaintance of Smith speculates that it was so as not to be confused with Steve Smith, the drummer of Journey.&#10;&#10;Heatmiser&#10;&#10;Smith graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1991 with a degree in philosophy and political science. &quot;Went straight through in four years,&quot; he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. &quot;I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn&apos;t want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, &apos;This is your one and only chance to go to college and you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.&apos; Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day.&quot; After he graduated he &quot;worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and legal theory.&quot; While at Hampshire, Smith formed the band Heatmiser with classmate Neil Gust. After graduating from Hampshire, the band added drummer Tony Lash and bassist Brandt Peterson and began performing around Portland in 1992. The group released the albums Dead Air (1993) and Cop and Speeder (1994) as well as the Yellow No. 5 EP (1994) on Frontier Records, and were then signed to Virgin Records to release what became their final album Mic City Sons (1996).&#10;&#10;Smith had begun his solo career while still in Heatmiser, and the success of his first two releases created distance and tension with his band. Heatmiser disbanded prior to Mic City Sons&apos; release, prompting Virgin to put the album out inauspiciously through its independent arm, Caroline Records. A clause in Heatmiser&apos;s record contract with Virgin meant that Smith was still bound to it as an individual. The contract was later bought-out by DreamWorks prior to the release of his album, XO.&#10;&#10;Roman Candle&#10;&#10;His first release, Roman Candle (1994), came about when Smith&apos;s girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of &quot;the most recent eight songs that [he’d] recorded on borrowed four-tracks and borrowed guitar&quot; to Cavity Search Records. Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was only expecting a deal for a seven-inch record. Regarding the record, Smith said &quot;I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular. [...] The thing is that album was really well-received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed Heatmiser unfortunately.&quot; Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: &quot;The idea of playing [my music] for people didn&apos;t occur to me... because at the time it was the Northwest – Mudhoney and Nirvana – and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off.&quot; The instrumentation of the recordings was primarily acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by brief electric guitar riffs or a small drum set played with brushes. Only the final track, an instrumental titled &quot;Kiwi Maddog 20/20&quot; (a reference to the bum wine MD 20/20), had full band instrumentation.&#10;&#10;Smith&apos;s debut solo performance was at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from Roman Candle were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set comprised of B-sides, Heatmiser tunes, and unreleased tracks. Soon after this performance, he was asked to open for Mary Lou Lord on a week-long U.S. tour. Several more short tours followed, and Smith helped her record one of his songs &quot;I Figured You Out&quot;, which he once called &quot;a stupid pop song [written] in about a minute&quot; that he discarded for &quot;[sounding] like the fucking Eagles.&quot;&#10;Elliott Smith and Either/Or&#10;&#10;In 1995, the self-titled album Elliott Smith was released on Kill Rock Stars; the record featured a similar style of recording to Roman Candle, but not without hints of growth and experimentation. Though the majority of the album was recorded by Smith alone, friend and Spinanes vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on &quot;St. Ides Heaven&quot;, and Heatmiser guitarist Neil Gust played guitar on &quot;Single File&quot;. Several songs made reference to drugs, but Smith explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being about drugs specifically. Looking back, Smith felt that the album&apos;s pervasive mood gave him &quot;a reputation for being a really dark, depressed person,&quot; and said that he later made a conscious move toward more diverse moods in his music.&#10;&#10;In 1996, filmmaker Jem Cohen recorded Smith playing acoustic songs for the short film Lucky Three: an Elliott Smith Portrait. Two of these songs would appear on his next album, Either/Or, another Kill Rock Stars release that came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing bass, drums, keyboards and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title was derived from the two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard, which deals with such themes as existential despair, dread, death and God.&#10;&#10;By this time, Smith&apos;s already-heavy drinking was now being compounded with use of anti-depressants. At the end of the Either/Or tour, an intervention was staged by close friends of his in Chicago, but it proved ineffective.&#10;&#10;Miss Misery and the Oscars&#10;&#10;In 1996, Smith was tapped by director and fellow Portland resident Gus Van Sant to be a part of the soundtrack to his film, Good Will Hunting. Smith recorded an orchestral version of &quot;Between the Bars (Orchestral)&quot; with acclaimed composer Danny Elfman for the movie. Smith also contributed a new song, &quot;Miss Misery,&quot; and three other previously released tracks (&quot;No Name #3&quot;, from Roman Candle, and &quot;Angeles&quot; and &quot;Say Yes&quot;, from Either/Or). The film was a commercial and critical success, and Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for &quot;Miss Misery&quot;. Not eager to step into the limelight, he only agreed to perform the song at the ceremony after the producers informed him that his song would be played live that night — either by him or another musician of their choosing.&#10;&#10;On March 5, 1998, Smith made his network television debut on Late Night With Conan O&apos;Brien performing &quot;Miss Misery&quot; solo on acoustic guitar. A few days later, wearing a white suit, he played an abridged version of the song at the Oscars, accompanied by the house orchestra. James Horner and Will Jennings won the award that night for best song with &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; (sung by Celine Dion) from the film Titanic. Smith did not voice disappointment about not winning the award.&#10;&#10;Smith commented on the surrealism of the Oscars experience: &quot;That&apos;s exactly what it was, surreal... I enjoy performing almost as much as I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was a lot of people who didn&apos;t come to hear me play. I wouldn&apos;t want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day.&quot;&#10;XO and Figure 8&#10;&#10;In 1998, after the success of Either/Or and &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, Smith signed to a bigger independent record label, DreamWorks Records. Around the same time, Smith fell into depression, speaking openly of considering suicide, and on at least one occasion made a serious attempt at ending his own life. While in North Carolina, he became severely intoxicated and ran off a cliff. He landed on a tree, which badly impaled him but broke his fall. When questioned about his suicide attempt, he told an interviewer, &quot;Um, yeah – I jumped off a cliff. But it didn&apos;t work.&quot; Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which released Roman Candle), said about this time in Smith&apos;s life: &quot;I talked him out of thinking that he wanted to kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him.&quot; Smith&apos;s first release for DreamWorks was later that year. Titled XO, it was produced by the team of Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock. XO also contained some instrumentation from Los Angeles musicians Joey Waronker and Jon Brion. It contained a more full-sounding, baroque pop sound than any of his previous efforts, with songs featuring a horn section, Chamberlins and elaborate string arrangements and even a drum loop on the song &quot;Independence Day&quot;. His familiar double-tracked vocal and acoustic guitar style was still apparent. The album went on to peak at number 104 on the Billboard 200 and sold 400,000 copies (more than double that of each of his two Kill Rock Stars releases), becoming the best-selling release of his career. Smith&apos;s backing band during most of this period was the Portland-based group Quasi, consisting of former bandmate Sam Coomes on bass guitar and Coomes&apos;s ex-wife Janet Weiss on drums. Quasi also performed as the opening act at many shows on the tour, with Smith sometimes contributing bass, guitar or backing vocals. On October 17, 1998, Smith appeared on Saturday Night Live and performed &quot;Waltz #2.&quot; His backing band for this appearance was John Moen, Jon Brion, Rob Schnapf and Sam Coomes.&#10;&#10;In response to whether the change to a bigger record label would influence his creative control, Smith said: &quot;...sometimes people look at major labels as simply money-making machines, they&apos;re actually composed of individuals who are real people, and there&apos;s a part of them that needs to feel that part of their job is to put out good music.&quot; Smith also claimed in another interview that he never read his reviews for fear that they would interfere with his songwriting.&#10;&#10;Figure 8, which was released in 2000, featured the return of Rothrock, Schnapf, Brion, and Waronker, and was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in England. The album garnered generally positive reviews and peaked at number 99 on the Billboard 200. The album garnered praise for its power pop style and complex arrangements, described as creating a &quot;sweeping kaleidoscope of layered instruments and sonic textures.&quot; However, some reviewers felt that Smith&apos;s trademark dark and melancholy songwriting had lost some of its subtlety, with one reviewer likening some of the songs to &quot;the self-pitying complaints of an adolescent venting in his diary.&quot;&#10;&#10;Album art and promotional pictures showed Smith looking cleaned-up and put-together. An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, including television appearances on Late Night With Conan O&apos;Brien and The Late Show With David Letterman. However, Smith&apos;s condition began to deteriorate as he had become addicted to heroin either towards the end of or just after the Figure 8 tour.&#10;&#10;Final years and recording of From a Basement on the Hill&#10;&#10;A follow-up to Smith&apos;s 2000 album was originally planned to happen with Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded a substantial amount of music for the album, when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work up until that point. He later said: &quot;There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn&apos;t want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs.&quot; When Brion sent a bill for the abandoned sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer voiced what he believed to be intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith sent a message to the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell, a member of the band Goldenboy. McConnell told SPIN that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd (of The Flaming Lips) and Scott McPherson played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.&#10;&#10;One of the few highlights for Smith in 2001 was inclusion of his song &quot;Needle in the Hay&quot; in Wes Anderson&apos;s dark comedy The Royal Tenenbaums. The song plays during a suicide attempt. Smith was originally supposed to contribute a cover of The Beatles&apos; &quot;Hey Jude&quot; for the film, but when he failed to do so in time, Anderson had to use The Mutato Muzika Orchestra&apos;s version of the track instead. Anderson would later say that Smith &quot;was in a bad state&quot; at the time.&#10;&#10;Smith&apos;s live performances during 2001 and 2002 were infrequent, typically in the Pacific Northwest or Los Angeles. A review of his December 20, 2001 show at Portland&apos;s Crystal Ballroom stated concern over his appearance and performance: his hair was uncharacteristically greasy and long; his face was bearded and gaunt; and during his songs he exhibited alarming signs of &quot;memory-loss and butterfingers&quot;. The crowd would often have to shout out the lyrics (and in some cases, guitar chords) when Smith could not think of them.&#10;&#10;In the first of only three concerts performed in 2002, Smith co-headlined Northwestern University&apos;s &quot;A&amp;O Ball&quot; with Wilco on May 2 in Chicago. Smith&apos;s performance was described as &quot;undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician&quot; and an &quot;excruciating... nightmare&quot;. A reporter for the online magazine Glorious Noise made the statement &quot;...it would not surprise me at all if Elliott Smith ends up dead within a year.&quot;&#10;&#10;On November 25, 2002, Smith was involved in a brawl with the Los Angeles Police Department at a Flaming Lips/Beck concert. Smith later said he was defending a man he thought the police were harassing. Assuming that Smith was homeless, the officers allegedly beat and arrested him and his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba. The two spent the night in jail. Smith&apos;s hand and back were injured in the incident, causing him to cancel a number of shows. Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips and a friend of Smith&apos;s, stated concern over Smith&apos;s appearance and actions, saying that he &quot;saw a guy who had lost control of himself. He was needy, he was grumpy, he was everything you wouldn&apos;t want in a person. It&apos;s not like when you think of Keith Richards being pleasantly blissed out in the corner.&quot; Smith had attempted to go to rehab several times, but said he &quot;couldn&apos;t honestly do the first step... I couldn&apos;t say what you were supposed to say and mean it.&quot; In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center: &quot;What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you&apos;re on a drip bag, but the only thing that&apos;s in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I&apos;m not psychotic.&quot; After his 34th birthday on August 6, 2003, he gave up alcohol, caffeine, red meat, refined sugar and his longtime (sometimes abused) regimen of psychiatric medication. Director Mike Mills had been working with Smith during his final years and described Smith&apos;s troubles and apparent recovery: &quot;I gave the script to him, then he dropped off the face of the earth… He went through his whole crazy time, but by the time I was done with the film, he was making From a Basement on a Hill and I was shocked that he was actually making music.&quot; With things improving for Smith after several troubled years, he began experimenting with noise music and worked on his girlfriend Jennifer Chiba&apos;s iMac with the intent of learning how to record with computers, noting that it was the only method with which he was still unfamiliar. Smith jokingly labeled his experimental way of recording &quot;The California Frown&quot; (a play on the Beach Boys&apos; &quot;California Sound&quot;). He said of the songs: &quot;They&apos;re kind of more noisy with the pitch all distorted. Some are more acoustic, but there aren&apos;t too many like that. Lately I&apos;ve just been making up a lot of noise.&quot; He was also in the process of recording songs for the Thumbsucker soundtrack, including Big Star&apos;s &quot;Thirteen&quot;, and Cat Stevens&apos; &quot;Trouble&quot;. In August 2003, Suicide Squeeze Records put out a limited-edition vinyl single for &quot;Pretty (Ugly Before)&quot;, a song that Smith had been playing since the Figure 8 tour. Steve Hanft described the last six months of Smith&apos;s life as being &quot;like the light at the end of the tunnel&quot; and was convinced that Smith was clean and recovered.&#10;&#10;Death and reactions&#10;&#10;Elliott Smith died on October 21, 2003, at age 34 from two stab wounds to the chest. According to girlfriend Jennifer Chiba, with whom he was living at the time, the two were arguing, and she locked herself in the bathroom. Chiba heard him scream, and upon opening the door, saw Smith standing with a kitchen knife in his chest. She pulled the knife out, after which he collapsed and she called 911. Smith died in the hospital with the time of death listed as 1:36 p.m. While Smith&apos;s death was originally reported as a suicide, the official autopsy report released in December 2003 left open the question of possible homicide. A possible suicide note, written on a Post-it, read, &quot;I&apos;m so sorry—love, Elliott. God forgive me.&quot; According to Pitchfork, producer Larry Crane reported on his Tape Op message board that he had planned to help Smith mix his album in mid-November. Crane wrote: &quot;I hadn&apos;t talked to Elliott in over a year. His girlfriend, Jennifer, called me [last week] and asked if I&apos;d like to come to L.A. and help mix and finish [Smith&apos;s album]. I said yes, of course, and chatted with Elliott for the first time in ages. It seems surreal that he would call me to finish an album and then a week later kill himself. I talked to Jennifer this morning, who was obviously shattered and in tears, and she said, &apos;I don&apos;t understand, he was so healthy.&quot; The coroner&apos;s report revealed that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol were found in his system at the time of his death. The coroner did find anti-depressant and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder medications in his system, but at prescribed levels. With his death not being officially declared a suicide, a journalist noted that some have suspected foul play, but also that the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.&#10;&#10;Soon after his death, a fan memorial was initiated outside of Solutions Audio (4334 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California), the site at which the cover of the Figure 8 album was shot. Farewell messages to Smith were written on the wall, flowers were brought and photos, candles and empty bottles of alcohol mentioned in Smith&apos;s songs were left. The owner of Solutions has, as of April 2008, allowed the memorial to stand. Memorial concerts were held in several cities in America and England. A petition was soon put forth with intent to make part of the Silver Lake area a memorial park in Smith&apos;s honor. It received over 10,000 signatures, but no plans to go forth with the park have been announced. Another memorial is located inside Smith&apos;s former high school, Lincoln High, and was erected in July 2006.&#10;&#10;Since Smith&apos;s death, many musical acts have paid him tribute. Songs in tribute to, or about Smith have been released by Rilo Kiley (&quot;Ripchord&quot; and &quot;It Just Is&quot; on More Adventurous), Sparta (&quot;Bombs and Us&quot;), Ben Folds (&quot;Late&quot; on Songs for Silverman), Third Eye Blind (&quot;Elliott Smith&quot; on Symphony of Decay), Mary Lorson (&quot;Lonely Boy&quot; on Realistic), Rhett Miller (&quot;The Believer&quot; on The Believer), Earlimart (&quot;Heaven Adores You&quot; on Treble and Tremble), Pete Yorn (&quot;Bandstand in the Sky&quot; on Nightcrawler, a song jointly dedicated to Jeff Buckley), and Ginger Sling (&quot;Faith&quot; on the &quot;Room&quot; EP). Several tribute albums have been released since his death: To: Elliott From: Portland, Home to Oblivion: Elliott Smith Tribute, Remote Memory: A Tribute to Elliott Smith, A Tribute to Elliott Smith and The String Quartet Tribute to Elliott Smith.&#10;&#10;Posthumous releases&#10;&#10;From a Basement on the Hill, with almost four years in production, was released October 19, 2004 by ANTI- Records (a part of Epitaph Records). With Smith&apos;s family in control of his estate, they chose to bring in Rob Schnapf and Smith&apos;s ex-girlfriend Joanna Bolme to sort through and mix the album. Although predicted by Smith to be a double album (or a regular album with a &quot;bonus disc&quot;), it was released as a 15-track single album. Many of the darkest songs from the sessions (later leaked onto the Internet) were not included, such as &quot;True Love&quot; (which deals graphically with addiction and rehab), &quot;Abused&quot;, &quot;Stickman&quot; and &quot;Suicide Machine&quot; (a reworking of the Figure 8 era unreleased instrumental, &quot;Tiny Time Machine&quot;). It is rumored that it was the family&apos;s wishes not to have these songs on the record, as they had the final say in what should and should not be released. Reviews of the album were mostly very positive, but some were more critical; The Onion&apos;s A.V. Club wrote that &quot;the album he left behind turns out to be messy, complicated, and unquestionably not his defining work...the album still earns its place—not at the top, and unfortunately as a bookend—in a jarringly important body of work.&quot; Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing, a biography by Benjamin Nugent, was rushed to publication and hit stores shortly after From a Basement on the Hill, barely beyond the first anniversary of the musician&apos;s death. Smith&apos;s family, as well as Joanna Bolme, Jennifer Chiba, Neil Gust, Sam Coomes, and Janet Weiss, all declined to be interviewed and did not support the publication of the book. It contained interviews with Rob Schnapf, David McConnell, and Pete Krebs. The book received mixed reviews, with Publishers Weekly remarking that while &quot;Nugent manages to patch together the major beats of Smith&apos;s life, he can offer little meaningful insight&quot; and that Smith&apos;s fans &quot;will be disappointed by this short and shallow biography.&quot;&#10;&#10;On May 8, 2007, a posthumous two-disc compilation album entitled New Moon was released by Kill Rock Stars. The album contained 24 songs recorded by Smith between 1994 and 1997 during his tenure with the label. The songs consisted of demos, early versions, previously released b-sides and some unfinished tracks. In the U.S., the album debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week. The record received favorable reviews and was Metacritic&apos;s 16th best-reviewed album of 2007. A significant portion of the proceeds from album sales are to go to Outside In, a social service agency for low-income adults and homeless youth in Portland, Oregon.&#10;&#10;On October 25, 2007, a book titled Elliott Smith was released by Autumn de Wilde, which consists of photographs, handwritten lyrics and &quot;revealing talks with Smith&apos;s inner circle&quot;. De Wilde was responsible for the Figure 8 sleeve art, making a landmark and de facto Smith memorial of the Solutions Audio mural. A five-song CD featuring previously unreleased live recordings of Smith performing acoustically at Club Largo in Los Angeles was included in the release.&#10;&#10;Musical style and influences&#10;&#10;Smith respected and was inspired by many artists and styles, including U2, The Kinks, Elvis Costello, Motown and flamenco records, AC/DC, Scorpions, and Modest Mouse. Smith claimed to listen exclusively to select albums (such as The Marble Index by Nico) for months. Sean Croghan (a former roommate of Smith&apos;s and member of bands Jr. High and Crackerbash) said that Smith &quot;listened almost exclusively to slow jams&quot; in his senior year at college. Smith was also known to gain inspiration from novels, religion and philosophy. He liked classic literature, especially Samuel Beckett, T. S. Eliot, and Fyodor Dostoevsky (and other Russian novelists).&#10;&#10;Smith mentioned his admiration for Bob Dylan in several interviews, citing him as an early musical influence. He once commented: &quot;My father taught me how to play &quot;Don&apos;t Think Twice, It&apos;s All Right&quot;. I love Dylan&apos;s words, but even more than that, I love the fact that he loves words.&quot; Smith covered Dylan&apos;s &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot; several times in concert.&#10;&#10;Smith was a dedicated fan of The Beatles (as well as their solo projects), once noting that he had been listening to them frequently since he was about &quot;four years old&quot; and also claimed that hearing The White Album was his original inspiration to become a musician. In 1998, Smith recorded and contributed a cover of the Beatles song &quot;Because&quot; to the American Beauty soundtrack, which can be heard during the closing credits of the film. Although this was the only Beatles song that Smith ever officially released, he is known to have recorded at least one other (&quot;Revolution (Beatles Cover)&quot;, during the sessions for XO), and played many songs by both the band and the members&apos; solo projects at live concerts. &#10;&#10;Regarding his songwriting, Smith said: “The way I think about it is... I don&apos;t really think about it in terms of language, I think about it more like shapes. That&apos;s an interesting thing to talk about but it&apos;s difficult. I&apos;m really into chord changes. That was the thing that I liked when I was a kid. So, I&apos;m not like a... I don&apos;t make up &apos;a riff&apos; really. It&apos;s usually like... that sequence that has some implied melody in it or something like that.” Smith said that transitions were his favorite part of songs and that he preferred to write broader, more impressionistic music closer to pop rather than folk music. Smith compared his songs to stories or dreams, not purely confessional pieces that people could relate to. When asked about the dark nature of his songwriting and the cult following he was gaining, Smith said he felt it was merely a product of him writing songs that were strongly meaningful to him rather than anything contrived. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Elliott+Smith&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content> Malcolm John &quot;Mac&quot; Rebennack, Jr. (born November 21, 1940), better known by the stage name Dr. John (also Dr. John Creaux), is an American singer-songwriter, pianist and guitarist whose music combines blues, boogie woogie and rock and roll.  The winner of five Grammy awards, Rebennack was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by singer John Legend on Monday, March 14, 2011.&#10;&#10;Dr. John has been making his own idiosyncratic music since the 1960s. Along with Professor Longhair, Dr. John is heir to the rich New Orleans tradition. He is perhaps best known for &quot;Right Place, Wrong Time&quot;, an international hit in 1973, reissued and used on soundtracks many times since.&#10;&#10;Born in New Orleans, Louisiana, his professional musical career began as a session musician in New Orleans in the 1950s. Early on he also played guitar and was often known as Mac Rebennack. He switched to the bass (&quot;the lowest time of my life&quot;), and then the piano after his index finger was nearly shot off protecting his bandmate and longtime friend Ronnie Barron. He gained fame beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with music that combined New Orleans-style rhythm and blues with psychedelic rock and stage shows that bordered on voodoo religious ceremonies, including elaborate costumes and headdress. For a time he was billed as Doctor John, The Night Tripper. The name &quot;Dr. John&quot; came from a legendary Louisiana voodoo practitioner from the start of the 19th century.&#10;&#10;Dr. John has also done vocals for Popeyes Chicken &amp; Biscuits&apos; &quot;Luv dat chicken...&quot; jingle, as well as the theme song (&quot;My Opinionation&quot;) for the early-1990s television sitcom Blossom. His movie credits include Martin Scorsese&apos;s documentary The Last Waltz (in which he joins The Band for a performance of his song &quot;Such a Night&quot;) and Blues Brothers 2000 (in which he joins the fictional band The Louisiana Gator Boys to perform the song &quot;New Orleans&quot;).  In the 2009 Disney film The Princess and the Frog, Dr. John sings the opening tune, &quot;Down in New Orleans&quot;.&#10;&#10;In January 2008 Mac Rebennack, Dr. John, was inducted into The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame.&#10;&#10;&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Dr.+John&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

Their first few releases appeared on the Catalogue imprint and were lapped up by those seeking a way to wind down after a night of furious funking to the likes of Pepe Bradock and Daft Punk. &quot;Mundo&quot; has been licensed from Catalogue for the Wagram Music double CD, Paris Lounge. It sits comfortably (on a chaise longue) next to cuts from Llorca, Le Tone, Kojak, and Next Evidence. Tim &apos;Love&apos; Lee fans will be impressed by the way Sporto Kantes combine Latin and Afro-Cuban influences with modern breakbeat technology. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Sporto+Kantes&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

She sings in both French and English.&#10;&#10;Besides the highly successful &quot;Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son&quot;, she&apos;s also notably sung &quot;Les Sucettes&quot; and &quot;Baby Pop&quot;.  In France, she is perhaps more known for the chanson songs she sang in the late-70s through the mid-80s, many of them which written by her husband, Michel Berger, who is now deceased. In 1987, she had some additional international success with her Ella Fitzgerald tribute &quot;Ella, elle l&apos;a&quot;.

<content>There are 3 bands with the name Simon Says.  One is a hard rock band from California, and the other is a prog rock band from Sweden. Simon Says is also a band from Estonia, Narva. They&apos;re a metalcore band with nu metal influences.&#10;&#10;Simon Says (U.S.):&#10;Simon Says was formed by a group of California high schoolers (Matt Franks, Zac Diebels, and Mike Johnston) who got their start playing high school auditoriums around the state in the early 1990s. Adding bassist Mike Arrieta in 1995, the group self-released two records, which attracted the attention of manager Jeff Saltzman. Saltzman set them up with Cake&apos;s producer Mark Needham and got them signed to Hollywood Records in July 1998. In 1999, they released their major-label debut, Jump Start, which yielded two hit modern rock singles, and the follow-up Shut Your Breath added a third radio hit.&#10;&#10;In 2001, Simon Says left Hollywood Records over promotional issues and changed their name to Key to Arson; soon after, drummer Mike Johnston left the band, to be replaced by Dave &quot;Stixx&quot; Marich. In 2004, Key to Arson announced the completion of an album entitled Light &apos;Em Up, but by the end of the year the band had broken up.&#10;&#10;Simon Says (Sweden):&#10;Stockholm in the early 90&apos;s was throbbing with prog. Numerous bands played small clubs and pubs in Sweden&apos;s capital. Most attention was paid to Anekdoten, Änglagaard and Landberk. &#10;&#10;On the fringes of this underground movement there was a less known band called Egg. An unorthodox band: while sounding as harsh and brutal as both VdGG and Crimson, they still struggled to make their melodies as catchy as those of pop tune. &#10;&#10;Bass player of Egg at the time was Stefan Renström, who upon joining them immediately had sensed the band&apos;s potential. But when Stefan wanted to lead the band in a certain direction, a lot of friction surfaced. Furthermore, his personal life collapsed and Stefan, unhappily, left both the band and Stockholm to form a new outfit. &#10;&#10;Around Christmas &apos;93 he made contact with a then very young Daniel Fäldt, singer of experimental band Leifs Hyvel. Things were settled: Simon Says was to be a project with the two of them as the nucleus. &#10;&#10;In March &apos;94 Stefan and producer Kenneth Magnusson started planning Simon Says&apos; first album. In August 1995 Ceinwen was released, to mostly positive reviews. A live act was put together and Simon Says looked like they were growing into a band. After a few gigs, however, the project was put on ice Stefan wasn&apos;t happy with the way Simon Says sounded and when both he and Daniel moved they suddenly were too far away from each other to be able to continue anyhow. Daniel started studying philosophy, then drifted off to India and the Middle East for two long periods. Meanwhile, Stefan focused on his role as bass player in his other band, Wagnerian space rockers The Moor, with whom he cut Flux in 1996. &#10;&#10;So, while Daniel was studying sitar in India, Stefan and The Moor toured Europe with legendary singer/flute and sax player Nik Turner of Hawkwind. Then, in 2001, Stefan felt he had somehow written a new Simon Says album. Guitarist Jonas Hallberg, Stefan&apos;s stand-in on bass in The Moor, was recruited, as well as Mattias Jarlhed (from Valinor&apos;s Tree) who recorded the drum parts only four days after having been invited to join. &#10;&#10;After four weeks Paradise Square was finished and a deal with Galileo records was struck. The album was released in July 2002 and was met by everything between very good and rave reviews. But after eight months of sporadic rehearsals the band was shelved. Again. &#10;&#10;Stefan refused to give Simon Says up, though. In spite of a series of domestic problems culminating in a tragic divorce he dedicated every spare second to write and record new music. And so, the band has in the last years contributed to a series of Musea samplers while all the time working on the main project: the one about survival. Tardigrade. &#10;&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Simon+Says&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<summary>The Limp Twins are Will Holland (a.k.a quantic) and Russell Porter, who created their album tales from beyond the groove (TRUCD057, 2003) in their bedrooms (according to the cd cover). The record is a funky offering somewhere in between the sound of Will Holland&apos;s other projects, quantic and the quantic soul orchestra, but is definately more laid back. &#10;&#10;For more information on this project, check out quantic&apos;s website: about The Limp Twins. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/The+Limp+Twins&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;</summary>

<content>Curtis Ousley (February 7, 1934 – August 13, 1971), who performed under the stage name King Curtis, was an American saxophone virtuoso known for rhythm and blues, rock and roll, soul, blues, funk and soul jazz. Variously a bandleader, band member, and session musician, he was also a musical director and record producer. Adept at tenor, alto, and soprano saxophone, he was best known for his distinctive riffs and solos such as on The Coasters - Yakety Yak, which later became the inspiration for Boots Randolph&apos;s &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; and his own &quot;Memphis Soul Stew&quot;.&#10;&#10;Curtis Ousley was adopted, with his sister, Josephine Ousley Allen. They were raised together in Fort Worth, Texas. Ousley attended I.M. Terrell High School, and studied and performed music with schoolmate Ornette Coleman.&#10;&#10;Ousley started playing saxophone at the age of twelve in the Fort Worth area. He took interest in many musical genres including jazz, rhythm and blues, and popular music. As a student pursuing music, he turned down college scholarships in order to join the Lionel Hampton Band. During his time with Hampton, he was able to write and arrange music and learn guitar. In 1952 Curtis decided to move to New York and became a session musician, recording for such labels as Prestige, Enjoy, Capitol, and Atco. He recorded with Nat Adderley, Wynton Kelly, Buddy Holly, Waylon Jennings and Andy Williams.&#10;&#10;Stylistically, Curtis took inspiration from saxophonists Lester Young, Louis Jordan, Illinois Jacquet, Earl Bostic, and Gene Ammons. Known for his syncopated and percussive style, he was both versatile and powerful as a musician. He put together a group during his time as a session musician that included Richard Tee, Cornell Dupree, Jerry Jemmott, and Bernard Purdie.&#10;&#10;King Curtis enjoyed playing jazz and rhythm &amp; blues but decided he would make more money as a rhythm &amp; blues musician, stating in a 1971 interview with Charlie Gillet that &quot;I love the authentic rhythm &amp; blues more than anything, and I also like to live well.&quot; From the 1950s until the mid-1960s, he worked as a session player, recording under his own name and with others such as the Coasters, with whom he recorded &quot;Yakety Yak.&quot; Buddy Holly hired him for session work, during which they recorded &quot;Reminiscing.&quot; Holly wrote this song, but gave Curtis the songwriting credit for flying down to the session. His best-known singles from this period are &quot;Soul Twist&quot; and &quot;Soul Serenade.&quot; He provided backing on a number of songs for LaVern Baker, including her 1958 hit single &quot;I Cried a Tear&quot;, where his saxophone became &quot;a second voice&quot;.&#10;&#10;In 1965, he moved to Atlantic Records and recorded his most successful singles, &quot;Memphis Soul Stew&quot; and &quot;Ode to Billie Joe&quot; (1967). He worked with The Coasters, led Aretha Franklin&apos;s backing band The Kingpins. The Kingpins opened for The Beatles during their 1965 performance at Shea Stadium. Curtis produced records, often working with Jerry Wexler and recorded for Groove Records during this period, including the Joe South song &quot;Games People Play&quot; with guitarist Duane Allman.&#10;&#10;In March 1971 he appeared with Aretha Franklin and The Kingpins at the Fillmore West, which resulted in two live albums: Aretha Live at Fillmore West, and Curtis&apos; own Live at Fillmore West. In July 1971, Curtis recorded saxophone solos on &quot;It&apos;s So Hard&quot; and &quot;I Don&apos;t Wanna Be a Soldier&quot; from John Lennon&apos;s Imagine. Along with The Rimshots, he recorded the original theme song for the 1971 hit television show, Soul Train, titled &quot;Hot Potatoes.&quot;&#10;&#10;Curtis was killed on August 13, 1971 when he was stabbed during an argument with a pair of drug dealers he discovered on the steps outside his Manhattan apartment. Curtis was attempting to carry an air conditioner into his apartment when Juan Montanez refused to move from the entrance. A fight ensued and Montanez stabbed Curtis. Curtis later died at Roosevelt Hospital. In March 1972, Montanez was sentenced to seven years for second-degree manslaughter, but was released in late 1977 for good behavior.&#10;&#10;On the day of Curtis&apos; funeral Atlantic Records closed their offices. Jesse Jackson administered the service and as the mourners filed in, Curtis&apos; band &apos;The Kingpins&apos; played &quot;Soul Serenade&quot;. Among those attending were Ousley&apos;s immediate family, including sister Josephine Ousley Allen, other family members, Aretha Franklin, Cissy Houston, Brook Benton and Duane Allman. Franklin sang the closing spiritual &quot;Never Grow Old&quot; and Stevie Wonder performed &quot;Abraham, Martin and John and now King Curtis&quot;.&#10;&#10;Curtis was subsequently buried in a red granite-fronted wall crypt in the &apos;West Gallery of Forsythia Court&apos; mausoleum at Pinelawn Memorial Park in Farmingdale, New York, the same cemetery that holds jazz greats Count Basie and John Coltrane.&#10;&#10;In 1970, a year before his death, Curtis won the Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance Grammy for &quot;Games People Play&quot;.&#10;&#10;Curtis was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 6, 2000.&#10;&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/King+Curtis&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>The Quantic Soul Orchestra is a live funk project initiated by Will Holland, aka Quantic, which eschews the use of samples in favour of a rawer &apos;70s sound. Considered one of the main acts in the modern funk movement.&#10;&#10;Releases&#10;- Stampede (2003)&#10;- Pushin&apos; On (2005)&#10;- I&apos;m Thankful (2006)&#10;- Tropidélico (2007)&#10;&#10;&quot;Putting something back&quot; is how Will Holland described the reason for starting The Quantic Soul Orchestra. Having released two succesful albums on Tru Thoughts under his Quantic guise - The 5th Exotic and Apricot Morning (which fused jazzy and breakbeat sounds), he felt his next musical adventure would be to focus on the album Stampede. The Quantic Soul Orchestra is a live project, strictly no samples allowed. Influenced by Mr Holland&apos;s love of the dusty funk 45&apos;s, he wanted to record and produce an album with creative and like minded musicians.&#10;&#10;With pop acts in the 2000s now using hip-hop beats (beats which are heavily influenced by funk records from the 70s) it was important for the QSO to make their sound rough, raw and real - it&apos;s definitely not Acid Jazz but has a deeper funk sound that shows that this music is well and truly alive in the new millennium. Their album Stampede was influenced by the many flamboyant (but often poor) musicians in the 70s who loved music for music&apos;s sake, who wanted to dance and make people dance.&#10;&#10;They are not trying to be retro and trendy, hence the cover version of 4 Hero&apos;s future soul anthem from 2002 Hold It Down. Sung in one take as vocalist Alice Russell warmed up before a recording session, it was decided that the original Holland penned instrumental should be replaced with this version. Ms Russell also lends her soulful voice to two other tracks on Stampede Something That&apos;s Real and Take Your Time, Change Your Mind. The other sung track finds John Hughes adding vocals (as well as some guitar and flute) to the classic QSO 7&quot; Super 8. The QSO also adds Afro Beat, Soul and Jazz influences to the Funk sound with musicians Dave Woodhouse (Clavinet, Rhodes and Trumpet), Damian Bell (Trombone), Antonia Pheulatos (String Arrangements and Violin), Lucy Holland (Saxophone), Richard Gibbs (Drums) and of course Will Holland himself (Guitars, Bass and Percussion) adding to the variety.&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/The+Quantic+Soul+Orchestra&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Anthony B is the stage name of Keith Blair (born March 31, 1976), a Jamaican musician.&#10;&#10;Blair grew up in rural Clarks Town in the northwestern parish of Trelawny. His deeply religious family life (his mother was a Seventh-day Adventist and his grandmother a Revivalist) imbued him with a profound spirituality. During his youth, his favorite singers were reggae legends Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer, musicians who strongly influenced his own style. Peter Tosh&apos;s influence can definitely be heard in Anthony B&apos;s vocal delivery and revolutionary stance.&#10;&#10;Anthony B adopted Rastafarian beliefs as a teenager, a decision which was not well-received by his family. The stubborn and determined Anthony B refused to give up his new religion and his dreadlocks and moved to the home of his aunt and uncle in the Kingston suburb, Portmore.&#10;&#10;While attending high school, Anthony B debuted as a deejay for the local sound system, Shaggy Hi-Power. In 1988, he befriended reggae artists such as Determine, Mega Banton, Ricky General and Terror Fabulous.&#10;&#10;At this point in the reggae industry, singing &quot;slack&quot; songs about women was the popular thing to do. Anthony B did not believe in degrading women and chose to pen politically-slanted songs rather than so-called &quot;gyal chunes.&quot; He hooked up with Little Devon the Half Pint sound-a-like singer he made his debut single &quot;The Living is Hard&quot; on the Wizard label in 1993. Anthony B tried many different producers but found that none of them fit his style of music. Finally, Anthony B teamed up with Richard &quot;Bello&quot; Bell, creating hits such as Fire Pon Rome, Raid Di Barn, Rumour, and Repentance Time. Anthony B&apos;s 1996 debut album Real Revolutionary was highly acclaimed in the reggae community. In late 1997, Anthony B released Universal Struggle which showed that Anthony B had a consistent, high-calibre talent. Anthony B has released a large number of albums since that time including 1999&apos;s Seven Seals and 2004&apos;s Untouchable which featured collaborations with artists including Wyclef Jean.&#10;&#10;Anthony B tours extensively in Europe and North America and is known for his fiery, high-energy performances.&#10;&#10;Anthony B is a member of the Bobo Ashanti branch of the Rastafarian movement. &quot;Bobo Dreads&quot;, as they are known, are recognizable by their long robes and turbans. The strong Afrocentric pride and the other Rastafarian beliefs (or &quot;overstandings&quot; as Rastafarians prefer to call them) which Anthony B holds are reflected in his songs.&#10;&#10;Discography&#10;&#10;    * Predator &amp; Prey (1996, Alpha Enterprises)&#10;    * Real Revolutionary / So Many Things (1996, Greensleeves)&#10;    * Universal Struggle (1997, VP Records)&#10;    * Seven Seals (1999, VP Records)&#10;    * That&apos;s Life (2001, VP Records)&#10;    * More Love (2001, AO ! Records)&#10;    * Live On The Battlefield (2002, Jahmin&apos; Records)&#10;    * Reggae Max (2002, Jet Star)&#10;    * Street Knowledge (2003, Nocturne)&#10;    * Judgment Time (2003, 2B1 Records)&#10;    * Smoke Free (2003, Bogalusa Records)&#10;    * Voice Of Jamaica vol. 2 (2003, Nocturne)&#10;    * Wise Man Chant (2004, Black Scorpio)&#10;    * Justice Fight (2004, Nocturne)&#10;    * Untouchable (2004, Togetherness Records)&#10;    * Power Of Creation (2004, Nocturne)&#10;    * Black Star (2005, Greensleeves)&#10;    * My Hope (2005, AL.TA.FA.AN. / Minor 7 Flat 5) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Anthony+B&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>There are at least two artists that have used this name:&#10;1. A roots reggae band from Jamaica&#10;2. A straight edge metalcore band from Florida, US&#10;&#10;1. Culture was a Jamaican roots reggae group founded in 1976. Originally they were known as the African Disciples.&#10;&#10;The members of the trio were Joseph Hill (lead vocals), Albert Walker (backing vocals) and Kenneth Dayes (backing vocals).&#10;&#10;Shortly after Culture came together, they began working with the &quot;Mighty Two&quot; – producer Joe Gibbs and engineer Errol Thompson. While at Gibbs’ studio, they recorded a series of powerful singles, many of which ended up on their debut album ‘Two Sevens Clash’. After their success with Gibbs, the group went on to make a string of albums for producer Sonia Pottinger. Culture began working with some of the premier musicians of the day including Robbie Shakespeare, Sly Dunbar, Ansel Collins, Cedric Brooks and the ever-present percussionist Sticky. Virgin Records picked up the albums, and that added distribution enabled Culture to gain an even larger following outside of Jamaica.&#10;&#10;Critically considered one of the most authentic traditional reggae acts, at the time of the first Rolling Stone Record Guide publication, they were the only band of any genre whose every recording received a five-star review (of bands with more than one recording in the guide).&#10;&#10;In 1982 the three singers went their own ways. Hill carried on using the Culture name, and recorded the Lion Rock album, which was released in the United States by Heartbeat Records. For their part, Walker and Dayes recorded a handful of songs on their own – a few of which turned up on an album titled Roots &amp; Culture. In 1986 the original line-up reformed to record two highly regarded albums – Culture in Culture and Culture at Work. These releases marked the beginning of a very busy period for the group, including annual albums and countless tours. The U.S. label Shanachie released a steady stream of new and old Culture albums up to Wings Of A Dove in 1992.&#10;&#10;Joseph Hill, who came to symbolize the face of Culture, died in Germany on 19 August 2006 while the group was on tour. His son, Kenyatta Hill, now is the lead singer.&#10;&#10;2) Classic mid/late 90s hardcore from Florida, celebrated for, among a handful of others, helping to cultivate the burgeoning metallic hardcore sound that became synonymous with the era.&#10;&#10;CULTURE was known for aggressive social/political/ecological commentary, cautionary tales of reckless consumerism and industrial sprawl, and advocacy of the straightedge lifestyle.&#10;&#10;Former members went on to Morning Again, Terror, As Friends Rust, Shai Hulud, Throwdown, Blood Has Been Shed and (most recently) ON BODIES.&#10;&#10;In 2012, CULTURE played its first show since disbanding in 1998 (The Reel &amp; Restless Fest in Miami, Florida). This fall, in August of 2013, the band will revisit Europe for Belgium&apos;s famed Ieper Hardcore Festival, and will then play three dates in Japan, including Tokyo&apos;s Bloodaxe Fest.&#10;&#10;Members included:&#10;&#10;Rich Thurston (Guitar: 1993-1997, Bass: 1993, Vocals: 1993, Drums: 1996)&#10;Josh Williams (Drums: 1993-1997)&#10;Stan Obal (Bass: 1993)&#10;Mark Mitchell (Vocals: 1993, Vocals: 1996)&#10;Pete Carreno (Bass: 1994)&#10;John Wylie (Guitar: 1994-1995)&#10;Damien Moyal (Vocals: 1994-1995, Vocals: 1997-1998)&#10;Gordon Tarpley (Bass: 1995-1997, Guitar: 1998)&#10;Louie Long (Vocals: 1995)&#10;Anthony Conte (Vocals: 1995)&#10;Steve Looker (Guitar: 1996-1997)&#10;Jason Dooley (Drums: 1997)&#10;Timothy Kirkpatrick (Drums: 1997-1998)&#10;Joe Simmons (Guitar:1997-1998)&#10;Floyd Beckham (Bass: 1998)&#10;Kenneth Brian (Guitar: 1998)&#10; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Culture&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>There are various artists named Fabian:&#10;&#10;1)  Fabiano Anthony Forte (born February 6, 1943, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania),is an American teen idol of the late 1950s and early 1960s. He rose to national prominence after performing several times on American Bandstand. In total, he charted 11 hit singles on the Billboard Hot 100.&#10;abian was discovered in 1957 by Bob Marcucci and Peter DeAngelis, owners of Chancellor Records. At the time, record producers were looking to the South Philadelphia neighborhoods in search of teenage talents with good looks, and Frankie Avalon, also of South Philly, suggested Fabian as a possibility.&#10;With songwriters Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, Fabian released a series of hit singles for Chancellor Records including &quot;I&apos;m a Man&quot;, &quot;Hound Dog Man&quot;, a #9 hit in the U.S., &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot; (U.S. #9), and his biggest hit, &quot;Tiger&quot;, which reached number 3 in the U.S. charts. Other singles that charted included &quot;String Along&quot;, &quot;About This Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;This Friendly World&quot;, which reached #12 on the U.S. charts.&#10;His career in music basically ended after he bought out of his contract with Marcucci after signing a seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox. During the payola scandal of the 1960s, Fabian testified before Congress that his recordings had been doctored electonically to significantly improve his voice.&#10;&#10;2) Fabian Ordorica of Los Angeles. Churning out heavy apocalyptic electro powerhouses and pop gems alike, Fabian is a multi-talented musician and producer. His songs are heavy, dark, and taking dance music in an entirely new direction. His live show is entirely original productions strung together in a non-stop, melt your face revolution. He promises to get any group of people in front of him dancing until their clothes are soaked. Since his productions are original, his live set will never get stale, and promises to get the interest of anyone seeing him play. He is a member of the Binary Family, a fast rising label of electronic musicians in Los Angeles.&#10;&#10;3) Fabian Feyaerts is the Belgian representative at Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2012. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Fabian&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>Michelle Lynn Johnson officially changed her professional name from Me&apos;Shell NdegéOcello to simply Meshell Ndegeocello, with the release of her 2001 album, &quot;Cookie: The Anthropological Mixtape&quot;.&#10;&#10;Meshell Ndegeocello (b. August 29, 1968) is a singer, bassist, and multi-instrumentalist. She was born Michelle Johnson to Army lieutenant (and saxophonist) father Jacques Johnson and her mother, Helen in Berlin, Germany.&#10;&#10;Raised in Washington, D.C., Meshell Suihailia Bashir Shakur (as she became known) adopted the surname Ndegeocello, which means &quot;free like a bird&quot;, while still in her teens. She has been hailed in the music press as a redeemer of soul music. Her music incorporates funk, soul, hip-hop, reggae, rock and jazz. She has been nominated for 9 Grammys.

<content>There are various artists named Fabian:&#10;&#10;1)  Fabiano Anthony Forte (born February 6, 1943, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania),is an American teen idol of the late 1950s and early 1960s. He rose to national prominence after performing several times on American Bandstand. In total, he charted 11 hit singles on the Billboard Hot 100.&#10;abian was discovered in 1957 by Bob Marcucci and Peter DeAngelis, owners of Chancellor Records. At the time, record producers were looking to the South Philadelphia neighborhoods in search of teenage talents with good looks, and Frankie Avalon, also of South Philly, suggested Fabian as a possibility.&#10;With songwriters Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, Fabian released a series of hit singles for Chancellor Records including &quot;I&apos;m a Man&quot;, &quot;Hound Dog Man&quot;, a #9 hit in the U.S., &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot; (U.S. #9), and his biggest hit, &quot;Tiger&quot;, which reached number 3 in the U.S. charts. Other singles that charted included &quot;String Along&quot;, &quot;About This Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;This Friendly World&quot;, which reached #12 on the U.S. charts.&#10;His career in music basically ended after he bought out of his contract with Marcucci after signing a seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox. During the payola scandal of the 1960s, Fabian testified before Congress that his recordings had been doctored electonically to significantly improve his voice.&#10;&#10;2) Fabian Ordorica of Los Angeles. Churning out heavy apocalyptic electro powerhouses and pop gems alike, Fabian is a multi-talented musician and producer. His songs are heavy, dark, and taking dance music in an entirely new direction. His live show is entirely original productions strung together in a non-stop, melt your face revolution. He promises to get any group of people in front of him dancing until their clothes are soaked. Since his productions are original, his live set will never get stale, and promises to get the interest of anyone seeing him play. He is a member of the Binary Family, a fast rising label of electronic musicians in Los Angeles.&#10;&#10;3) Fabian Feyaerts is the Belgian representative at Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2012. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Fabian&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>There are various artists named Fabian:&#10;&#10;1)  Fabiano Anthony Forte (born February 6, 1943, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania),is an American teen idol of the late 1950s and early 1960s. He rose to national prominence after performing several times on American Bandstand. In total, he charted 11 hit singles on the Billboard Hot 100.&#10;abian was discovered in 1957 by Bob Marcucci and Peter DeAngelis, owners of Chancellor Records. At the time, record producers were looking to the South Philadelphia neighborhoods in search of teenage talents with good looks, and Frankie Avalon, also of South Philly, suggested Fabian as a possibility.&#10;With songwriters Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, Fabian released a series of hit singles for Chancellor Records including &quot;I&apos;m a Man&quot;, &quot;Hound Dog Man&quot;, a #9 hit in the U.S., &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot; (U.S. #9), and his biggest hit, &quot;Tiger&quot;, which reached number 3 in the U.S. charts. Other singles that charted included &quot;String Along&quot;, &quot;About This Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;This Friendly World&quot;, which reached #12 on the U.S. charts.&#10;His career in music basically ended after he bought out of his contract with Marcucci after signing a seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox. During the payola scandal of the 1960s, Fabian testified before Congress that his recordings had been doctored electonically to significantly improve his voice.&#10;&#10;2) Fabian Ordorica of Los Angeles. Churning out heavy apocalyptic electro powerhouses and pop gems alike, Fabian is a multi-talented musician and producer. His songs are heavy, dark, and taking dance music in an entirely new direction. His live show is entirely original productions strung together in a non-stop, melt your face revolution. He promises to get any group of people in front of him dancing until their clothes are soaked. Since his productions are original, his live set will never get stale, and promises to get the interest of anyone seeing him play. He is a member of the Binary Family, a fast rising label of electronic musicians in Los Angeles.&#10;&#10;3) Fabian Feyaerts is the Belgian representative at Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2012. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Fabian&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>There are various artists named Fabian:&#10;&#10;1)  Fabiano Anthony Forte (born February 6, 1943, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania),is an American teen idol of the late 1950s and early 1960s. He rose to national prominence after performing several times on American Bandstand. In total, he charted 11 hit singles on the Billboard Hot 100.&#10;abian was discovered in 1957 by Bob Marcucci and Peter DeAngelis, owners of Chancellor Records. At the time, record producers were looking to the South Philadelphia neighborhoods in search of teenage talents with good looks, and Frankie Avalon, also of South Philly, suggested Fabian as a possibility.&#10;With songwriters Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, Fabian released a series of hit singles for Chancellor Records including &quot;I&apos;m a Man&quot;, &quot;Hound Dog Man&quot;, a #9 hit in the U.S., &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot; (U.S. #9), and his biggest hit, &quot;Tiger&quot;, which reached number 3 in the U.S. charts. Other singles that charted included &quot;String Along&quot;, &quot;About This Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;This Friendly World&quot;, which reached #12 on the U.S. charts.&#10;His career in music basically ended after he bought out of his contract with Marcucci after signing a seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox. During the payola scandal of the 1960s, Fabian testified before Congress that his recordings had been doctored electonically to significantly improve his voice.&#10;&#10;2) Fabian Ordorica of Los Angeles. Churning out heavy apocalyptic electro powerhouses and pop gems alike, Fabian is a multi-talented musician and producer. His songs are heavy, dark, and taking dance music in an entirely new direction. His live show is entirely original productions strung together in a non-stop, melt your face revolution. He promises to get any group of people in front of him dancing until their clothes are soaked. Since his productions are original, his live set will never get stale, and promises to get the interest of anyone seeing him play. He is a member of the Binary Family, a fast rising label of electronic musicians in Los Angeles.&#10;&#10;3) Fabian Feyaerts is the Belgian representative at Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2012. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Fabian&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.

<content>There are various artists named Fabian:&#10;&#10;1)  Fabiano Anthony Forte (born February 6, 1943, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania),is an American teen idol of the late 1950s and early 1960s. He rose to national prominence after performing several times on American Bandstand. In total, he charted 11 hit singles on the Billboard Hot 100.&#10;abian was discovered in 1957 by Bob Marcucci and Peter DeAngelis, owners of Chancellor Records. At the time, record producers were looking to the South Philadelphia neighborhoods in search of teenage talents with good looks, and Frankie Avalon, also of South Philly, suggested Fabian as a possibility.&#10;With songwriters Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman, Fabian released a series of hit singles for Chancellor Records including &quot;I&apos;m a Man&quot;, &quot;Hound Dog Man&quot;, a #9 hit in the U.S., &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot; (U.S. #9), and his biggest hit, &quot;Tiger&quot;, which reached number 3 in the U.S. charts. Other singles that charted included &quot;String Along&quot;, &quot;About This Thing Called Love&quot; and &quot;This Friendly World&quot;, which reached #12 on the U.S. charts.&#10;His career in music basically ended after he bought out of his contract with Marcucci after signing a seven-year contract with 20th Century Fox. During the payola scandal of the 1960s, Fabian testified before Congress that his recordings had been doctored electonically to significantly improve his voice.&#10;&#10;2) Fabian Ordorica of Los Angeles. Churning out heavy apocalyptic electro powerhouses and pop gems alike, Fabian is a multi-talented musician and producer. His songs are heavy, dark, and taking dance music in an entirely new direction. His live show is entirely original productions strung together in a non-stop, melt your face revolution. He promises to get any group of people in front of him dancing until their clothes are soaked. Since his productions are original, his live set will never get stale, and promises to get the interest of anyone seeing him play. He is a member of the Binary Family, a fast rising label of electronic musicians in Los Angeles.&#10;&#10;3) Fabian Feyaerts is the Belgian representative at Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2012. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.last.fm/music/Fabian&quot;&gt;Read more on Last.fm&lt;/a&gt;.
